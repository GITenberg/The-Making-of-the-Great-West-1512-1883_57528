"<i>Time's noblest offspring is the last.</i>"
</p>

<p>
This history is intended to meet, so far as it may, the
want for brief, compact, and handy manuals of the beginnings
of our country.
</p>

<p>
Although primarily designed for young people, the fact
has not been overlooked that the same want exists among
adult readers, to whom an intelligent view of the subject,
in a little space, is nowhere accessible.
</p>

<p>
For the purpose in hand, the simplest language consistent
with clearness has been made use of, though I have never
hesitated to employ the right word, whenever I could command
it, even if it were of more than three syllables.
</p>

<p>
As in the "Making of New England," "this book aims
to occupy a place between the larger and lesser histories,—to
so condense the exhaustive narrative as to give it greater
vitality, or so extend what the narrow limits of the school-history
often leave obscure as to supply the deficiency.
Thus, when teachers have a particular topic before them,
it is intended that a chapter on the same subject be read to
fill out the bare outlines of the common-school text-book.
</p>

<p>
"To this end the plan has been to treat each topic as a
unit, to be worked out to a clear understanding of its objects
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_viii' name='Page_viii' href='#Page_viii'>viii</a></span>
and results before passing to another topic. And in furtherance
of this method, each subject has its own descriptive
notes, maps, plans and pictorial illustration, so that all may
contribute to a thorough knowledge of the matter in hand.
The several topics readily fall into groups that have an
apparent or underlying connection, which is clearly brought
out."
</p>

<p>
In this volume, I have followed up to its legitimate ending
the work done by the three great rival powers of modern
times in civilizing our continent. I have tried to make it
the worthy, if modest, exponent of a great theme. The story
grows to absorbing interest, as the great achievement of the
age,—of the Anglo-Saxon overcoming the Latin race, as
one great wave overwhelms another with resistless force.
</p>

<p>
Under the title of "The Great West," the present volume
deals mostly with the section lying beyond the Mississippi.
Another is proposed, in which the central portion of the
Union will be treated. The completed series, it is hoped,
will present something like a national portrait of the American
people.

The story we have to tell was the problem of the
sixteenth century, and is no less the marvel of
the nineteenth. Put in the simplest
possible form, the riddle to be solved
in every palace of Christendom was,
"How is the discovery of a new world
going to affect mankind?"
</p>

<p class="caption">SPANISH ARMS.</p>
</div>

<p>
To make the whole story clear, from
beginning to end, calls for an effort to
first put ourselves in relation with that
remote time,—its thought, its interests,
its aims and civilization. Let us
try to do this now, at this time, when
from our standpoint of achieved success
we may calmly look back over the
field, and see clearly the causes which
have led up to it in orderly succession.
</p>

<p>
In the very beginning we see three rival civilizations.
We see different nations, each of which is putting forth
efforts to grasp dominion in, or stamp its own civilization
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_2' name='Page_2' href='#Page_2'>2</a></span>
upon, the New World in despite of the other.
We see civilization apparently engaged in defeating its
own ends. Naturally, then, our first interest centres in
the combatants themselves. Who and what are these
Old World gladiators, who, in making choice of the
New for their arena, have stripped for the encounter?
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="i-013" id="i-013"></a>
<img src="images/i-013.jpg" width="400" height="334" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SHIP OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.</p>
</div>

<p>
Great affairs were engaging the attention of the civilized
world, so great that nearly all Europe was up in
arms. It was the era of unsettled conditions,—of old
jealousies and animosities revived, of new opportunities
and new adjustments created by them. But among the
nations of Europe power was very differently distributed
from what we see it to-day. Spain, not England,
was acknowledged mistress of the seas. Not yet had
England wrested that proud title from her ancient rival
in the greatest naval battle of the century. Drake and
Frobisher had not been born. Hawkins was a lad,
strolling about the quays of his native seaport. Who,
then, should dispute with Spain dominion of the seas?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_3' name='Page_3' href='#Page_3'>3</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The royal standard of Spain had indeed floated very
far at sea. Columbus had borne it even in sight of the
shores of Mexico; but, though he had given to Spain
a new world, he, the man of his century, did not succeed
in finding his long-sought strait to India, and so
had died without seeing the one great purpose of his
life accomplished.
</p>

<div class="figright"> <!--1/2-->

<img src="images/i-014.jpg" width="220" height="263" alt="" />
<p class="caption">ISABELLA OF SPAIN.</p>
</div>

<p>
Yet Columbus, so to speak, was a lever of Archimedes,<a name='FA_1' id='FA_1' href='#FN_1' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a>
for with the greatness of his idea he had moved
both the Old World
and the New. The
Old was thrown into
commotion because of
his discoveries and
what they implied to
mankind, the New
thrilled with the new
life that stirred in her
bosom. Spain at once
stepped forward into
the front rank of nations.
How strange
and striking are the
events that have flowed
from this one idea
working in one man's brain! And where, in all the
history of the world, shall we look for their equal?
</p>

<p>
By the time Columbus had returned to Spain, the
Portuguese mariner, Diaz, had also discovered the Cape
of Good Hope. Upon this these two proud and powerful
nations, Spain and Portugal, agreed to divide between
themselves all the unknown lands and seas to
the east and to the west of a meridian line which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_4' name='Page_4' href='#Page_4'>4</a></span>
should be drawn from pole to pole, one hundred and
seventy leagues west of the Azores. All other nations
were thus to be excluded from the New World.<a name='FA_2' id='FA_2' href='#FN_2' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a>
</p>

<p>
Having first secured a solid foothold in the Antilles,<a name='FA_3' id='FA_3' href='#FN_3' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a>
through Columbus and his discoveries, Spain early threw
out her expeditions into Florida (1512) and Mexico
(1519). The one was the logical result of the other,
for St. Domingo and Cuba now assumed distinct importance,
as stations, whence it was easy to move forward
upon new schemes of conquest. In the harbors
of these islands the Spaniards could refit their ships or
recruit their crews after the long ocean voyage from
Europe. Cuba, especially, became an arsenal of the
highest military importance, which Spain took great
pains to strengthen.
</p>

<p>
So at the very outset, Spain held this great advantage
over her competitors. She possessed a naval station
conveniently situated for making descents upon
the adjacent coasts, which none of them was able to
secure for themselves.
</p>

<p>
Columbus died in 1506; Ferdinand, King of Spain,
whose name by the accident of time is linked in with
that of Columbus, had also died; and now Charles,
who shortly was crowned Emperor of Germany, began
his most eventful reign. The period it covers is one
of the most momentous in modern history, and as great
occasions commonly bring forth great men, so those
monarchs who then ruled over the peoples of Europe
were worthy of the time in which they lived. Charles
was himself one of the greatest of these monarchs.
Francis I. of France was another; Henry VIII. of
England another. Hence we have felt justified in saying,
as we did at the beginning of this chapter, that our
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_5' name='Page_5' href='#Page_5'>5</a></span>
starting-point was fixed in an historic era; for every
thing betokened that as between such men as these
were the struggle was to be a contest of giants.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<img src="images/i-016.jpg" width="400" height="192" alt="" />
<p class="caption">MEDAL OF CHARLES V.</p>
</div>

<p>
During this reign the conquests of Mexico and Peru
took place. During this reign Spain was raised to such
a height of greatness as had never before been known
in her history. Europe looked on in wonder to see
these grand schemes of conquest being carried on three
thousand miles away, while Spain's powerful neighbors
were kept in awe at home. The English poet Dryden,
who wrote a play upon the conquest of Mexico, makes
Cortez and Montezuma hold the following dialogue,
Cortez offering peace or war:—
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p><i>Mont.</i> Whence, or from whom dost thou these offers bring?</p>

<p><i>Cortez.</i> From Charles the Fifth, the world's most potent king.</p>
</div></div>

<p>
Other nations would gladly have shared the riches of
the New World with the conquerors, but Spain haughtily
warned away intruders, meaning to keep the prize
for herself alone.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_6' name='Page_6' href='#Page_6'>6</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It was then that Francis I. demanded to be shown
that clause in the will of Adam disinheriting him in
the New World. But Spain was too formidable to be
attacked on the seas. On the land, the two great rivals
met at Pavia, where the pride of France was laid so
low that after the battle was over, Francis wrote to his
mother the memorable words, so often made use of in
like emergencies, "Madam, all is lost except honor."
</p>

<p>
The pre-eminent
grandeur of Spain, at
this period, shines out
all the clearer by comparison
with the inferior
attitude of England,
not only as a
military power, but in
respect of peaceful
achievement. By the
light Spain carried in
the van of discovery
other nations moved
forward, but at a distance
indicating their
respect for the dictator of European politics.
</p>

<div class="figleft"> <!--1/2-->

<img src="images/i-017.jpg" width="220" height="258" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PONCE DE LEON.</p>
</div>

<p>
It is worth our remembering that in the efforts made
to obtain a foothold upon the mainland, or <i>terra firma</i>,<a name='FA_4' id='FA_4' href='#FN_4' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a>
as the Spaniards then called it, the territory of the
United States may claim precedence in the order of
time. Before Cortez landed in Mexico, Ponce de Leon
had discovered and named Florida. Therefore Florida
was the first portion of the North-American continent
to receive the baptism of a Christian name.<a name='FA_5' id='FA_5' href='#FN_5' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a>
</p>

<p>
Although, under this name of Florida, Spain first
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_7' name='Page_7' href='#Page_7'>7</a></span>
claimed every thing in North America, it was the great
central region lying about the tropics to which her
explorers first turned their attention.
</p>

<p>
Cortez landed on the Gulf Coast, unfurled his banner
of "blood and gold," set fire to his ships,<a name='FA_6' id='FA_6' href='#FN_6' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a> to let his
followers know that for him and them there was no
retreat, and marched on into the heart of Mexico.
Two initial points are thus fixed from which to continue
the story of Spanish domination in the New
World, Florida and Mexico.
</p>

<p>
Then again, having at last found their way across the
Isthmus of Darien to the South Sea<a name='FA_7' id='FA_7' href='#FN_7' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a> (1513), the Spaniards
in a measure ceased from their persistent and useless
search for an open water-way to India. Cortez
presently hewed out another road, with the sword,
across Mexico, to this great western ocean. His achievement
was quickly followed up by Ulloa (1539), Cabrillo
(1542), and other Spanish navigators, who were sent
by Cortez or the Viceroy to extend discovery up the
coast. They coasted the Gulf of California, first called
the Vermilion Sea, and sailed beyond it, as high as 30°
North latitude.
</p>

<p>
So thanks to Cortez, Spain had secured the much-coveted
way to India at last. Yet when he came home
to his native country, the king demanded of those about
him who Cortez was. "I am a man," said the conqueror
of Mexico, "who has gained your majesty more
provinces than your father left you towns."
</p>

<p>
Supreme on land and sea, Spain pushed on her conquests
abroad without hinderance. If such deeds as
hers had so irritated the self-love of a rival prince, how
must they have stirred the blood of all those daring
spirits by whom Charles was surrounded, and who
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_8' name='Page_8' href='#Page_8'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_9' name='Page_9' href='#Page_9'>9</a></span>
burned to distinguish themselves in the service of their
liege lord and sovereign. In America, men said the
making of a new empire had begun. If that were so,
it meant that men of energy, ambition and capacity,
the kind of men on whom fortune waits to bestow her
choicest favors, should seek her there.
</p>

</div>

<p>
But Mexico and Peru were already won. When,
therefore, the Spaniards began to look about them for
new worlds to conquer, their eyes fell upon Florida. It
is true that all those who had set forth upon this errand
met with nothing but disaster.<a name='FA_8' id='FA_8' href='#FN_8' class='fnanchor'>[8]</a> A spell seemed hanging
over this land of flowers. The Spaniards had
indeed, with much pomp, planted a cross, strangely
proclaiming themselves masters of the country; yet,
without power to hold a foot of ground, this cross stood
a monument to their failures, as its inscription seemed
an epitaph to their presumption.

DE SOTO'S DISCOVERY OF THE MISSISSIPPI.<a name='FA_9' id='FA_9' href='#FN_9' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a>
</h4>

<p class="center post">
"<i>One may buy gold at too dear a price.</i>"—<i>Spanish.</i>
</p>

<p>
If we look at the earliest Spanish maps on which the
Gulf of Mexico is laid down, not only do we find the
delta of a great river put in the place where we would
expect to see, on our maps of to-day, the Mississippi making
its triumphal entry into the sea, but the map-makers
have even given it a name—Rio del Espiritu Santo—meaning,
in their language, the River of the Holy Ghost.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">FRENCH MAP OF 1542. FROM JOMARD.</p>
</div>

<p>
That this knowledge ought not to detract from the
work of subsequent explorers is quite clear to our minds,
because the charts themselves show that only the coast
line<a name='FA_10' id='FA_10' href='#FN_10' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> had been examined when these results were put
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_11' name='Page_11' href='#Page_11'>11</a></span>
upon parchment. The explorers had indeed found a
river, and made a note of it, but had passed on their
way without so much as suspecting that the muddy
waters they saw flowing out of the land before them
drained a continent. Had they made this important
discovery, we cannot doubt their readiness to have
profited by it in making their third invasion of Florida.
So the discovery, if it can be called one, had no practical
value for those who made it, and the country
remained a sealed book as before. We cannot wonder
at this because La Salle subsequently failed to find the
river when actually searching for it, though he had
seen it before.
</p>

<p>
With 600 men, both horse and foot, thoroughly
equipped and ably led, Hernando de Soto<a name='FA_11' id='FA_11' href='#FN_11' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> set sail from
Havana in May, and
landed on the Florida
coast on Whitsunday<a name='FA_12' id='FA_12' href='#FN_12' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a>
of the year 1539.
</p>

<div class="figright"><!--1/2-->

<img src="images/i-022.jpg" width="220" height="229" alt="" />
<p class="caption">DE SOTO.</p>
</div>

<p>
De Soto did not
burn his ships, like
Cortes, but sent them
back to Havana to
await his further orders.
These Spaniards
had come, not
as peaceful colonists,
looking for homes and
a welcome among the
owners of the soil, but
as soldiers bent only upon conquest. De Soto, as we
have seen, had brought an army with him. Its camp
was pitched in military order. It moved at the trumpet's
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_12' name='Page_12' href='#Page_12'>12</a></span>
martial sound. Two hundred horsemen carrying
lances and long swords marched in the van. With
them rode the Adelantado, his standard-bearer and
suite. Behind these squadrons marched the men of all
arms—cross-bowmen, arquebusmen, calivermen, pikemen,
pages and squires, who attached themselves to
the officers in De Soto's train—then came the baggage
with its camp-guard of grooms and serving-men:
and last of all, another strong body of infantry solidly
closed the rear of the advancing column, so that
whether in camp or on the march, it was always ready
to fight. In effect, De Soto entered Florida sword in
hand, declaring all who should oppose him enemies.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<img src="images/i-023.jpg" width="400" height="354" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SOLDIER OF 1585.</p>
</div>

<p>
De Soto enforced an iron discipline, never failing,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_13' name='Page_13' href='#Page_13'>13</a></span>
like a good soldier, himself to set an example of obedience
to the orders published for the conduct of his
army. In following his fortunes, it is well to keep the
fact firmly in mind that De Soto was embarked in a
campaign for conquest only.
</p>

<p>
Toward the unoffending natives of the country the
invaders used force first, conciliation afterwards. As in
Mexico and Peru, so here they meant to crush out all
opposition,—to thoroughly subjugate the country to
their arms. De Soto had served under Pizarro, and had
shown himself an apt pupil of a cruel master. The
Indians were held to have no rights whatever, or at
least none that white men were bound to respect.
Meaning to make slaves of them, the Spaniards had
brought bloodhounds to hunt them down, chains with
iron collars to keep them from running away, and
wherever the army went these poor wretches were led
along in its train, like so many wild beasts, by their
cruel masters. On the march they were loaded down
with burdens. When the Spaniards halted, the captives
would throw themselves upon the ground like
tired dogs. When hungry they ate what was thrown
to the dogs. So far as known, Hernando de Soto was
the first to introduce slavery,<a name='FA_13' id='FA_13' href='#FN_13' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> in its worst form, into
the country of Florida, and in this manner did this
Christian soldier of a Christian prince set up the first
government by white men begun in any part of the
territory of the United States.
</p>

<p>
The Spaniards were seeking for the gold which they
believed the country contained. At the first landing, a
Spaniard,<a name='FA_14' id='FA_14' href='#FN_14' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a> who had lived twelve years among the
Florida Indians, was brought by them into the camp
among his friends. The first thing De Soto asked this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_14' name='Page_14' href='#Page_14'>14</a></span>
man was whether he knew of any gold or silver in the
country. When he frankly said that he did not, his
countrymen would not believe him. The Indians,
when questioned, pointed to the mountains, where gold
is, indeed, found to this day. Though he did not believe
him, De Soto took the rescued man along with him as
his interpreter.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<img src="images/i-025.jpg" width="400" height="383" alt="" />
<p class="caption">CUBAN BLOODHOUND.</p>
</div>

<p>
It was said, and by many believed, that somewhere
in Florida stood a golden city, ruled over by a king or
high priest who was sprinkled from head to foot with
gold-dust instead of powder. This story was quite
enough to excite the cupidity of the Spaniards, who
grew warm when speaking of this city as the El
Dorado,<a name='FA_15' id='FA_15' href='#FN_15' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a> or city of the Gilded One.
</p>

<p>
Such fables would not now be listened to by sensible
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_15' name='Page_15' href='#Page_15'>15</a></span>
people, but in the time we are writing of they were
firmly believed in, not only by the poor and ignorant,
but by the greatest princes in Christendom, as well.
No doubt they helped to fill De Soto's ranks. Lord
Bacon tells us that in all superstitions wise men follow
fools, and as this was a superstitious age, we can readily
believe him. The great, the prolific, the true mines of
the country, the cultivation of the soil, was not thought
of by these soldiers of fortune who followed De Soto
into Florida.
</p>

<p>
This ill-starred expedition is memorable rather for its
misfortunes than because of any service it has rendered
to civilization. Most graphically are these shadowed
forth in the death and burial of De Soto himself, and in
that sense they will stand for all time on the page of
history as a memorial to what men will dare and suffer
for greed of gold. In any other cause the expedition
would be worthy an epic.
</p>

<p>
Although composed of the best soldiers in the world,
with a valiant and skilful captain for its leader, the
little army became so hopelessly entangled, so utterly
lost in the primeval wildernesses, that to this day it has
never been possible to trace out the true course of that
fatal march.<a name='FA_16' id='FA_16' href='#FN_16' class='fnanchor'>[8]</a> Wherever he could hear of gold, thither
De Soto led his weary and footsore battalions. When
baffled on one side, he turned with rare perseverance to
another. And though they were being wasted in daily
combats, though famine and disease followed them step
by step through swamp and everglade, over mountains
and rivers, still, with wondrous fatuity, De Soto pushed
ever on. Like an enchantress his El Dorado had lured
him on to his destruction.
</p>

<p>
For about two years De Soto and his companions
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' name='Page_16' href='#Page_16'>16</a></span>
wholly passed from the knowledge of men. A miserable
remnant of this once gallant band then made
their way to the coast, not indeed as conquerors, but as
fugitives.<a name='FA_17' id='FA_17' href='#FN_17' class='fnanchor'>[9]</a>

<p>
Just where these years were passed is not clear.
Long ago time obliterated all traces of the invaders'
march. So the clew is lost. Yet we do know that one
day in May, 1541, two years after its first landing, the
army halted on the banks of an unknown river almost
half a league broad. One of the soldiers says of it,
that if a man stood still on the other side it could not
be discerned whether he was a man or no. The river
was of great depth, and of a strong tide which bore
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_17' name='Page_17' href='#Page_17'>17</a></span>
along with it continually many great trees. All doubt
vanishes. This could be no other than the "Father of
Waters" itself.

<h4>
DEATH AND BURIAL OF DE SOTO.
</h4>

<p class="center">
"<i>By a Portugall of the Company.</i>"
</p>

<p>
"The Gouernour felt in himselfe that the houre
approached, wherein he was to leaue this present life,
and called for the Kings Officers, Captaines and principall
persons. Hee named Luys de Moscoso de Aluarado
his Captaine generall. And presently he was
sworne by all that were present, and elected for Gouernour.
The next day, being the one and twentieth
of May, 1542, departed out of this life, the valorous,
virtuous, and valiant Captaine, Don Fernando de Soto,
Gouernour of Cuba, and Adelantado of Florida: whom
fortune aduanced, as it vseth to doe others, that he
might have the higher fall.<a name='FA_18b' id='FA_18b' href='#FN_18b' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> Hee departed in such a
place, and at such a time, as in his sicknesse he had
but little comfort: and the danger wherein all his people
were of perishing in that countrie, which appeared
before their eyes, was cause sufficient, why euery one
of them had neede of comfort, and why they did not
visite nor accompanie him as they ought to have done.
Luys de Moscoso determined to conceale his death from
the Indians, because Ferdinando de Soto had made
them beleeue, that the Christians were immortall; and
also because they tooke him to be hardy, wise, and valiant:
and if they should knowe that hee was dead,
they would be bold to set upon the Christians, though
they liued peaceably by them.
</p>

<p>
"As soon as he was dead, Luys de Moscoso commanded
to put him secretly in an house, where he
remayned three dayes: and remouing him from thence,
commanded him to be buried in the night at one of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_19' name='Page_19' href='#Page_19'>19</a></span>
gates of the towne within the wall. And as the Indians
had seene him sick, and missed him, so did they
suspect what might be. And passing by the place
where he was buried, seeing the earth moued, they
looked and spake one to another. Luys de Mososco
vnderstanding of it, commanded him to be taken up
by night, and to cast a great deale of sand into the
Mantles, wherein he was winded vp, wherein he was
carried in a canoa, and throwne into the midst of the
riuer. The Cacique of Guachoya inquired of him,
demanding what was become of his brother and lord,
the Gouernour: Luys de Moscoso told him, that he was
gone to Heauen, as many other times he did: and because
he was to stay there certaine dayes, he had left
him in his place. The Cacique thought with himselfe
that he was dead; and commanded two young and well
proportioned Indians to be brought thither; and said,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_20' name='Page_20' href='#Page_20'>20</a></span>
that the vse of that countrie was, when any Lord died,
to kill Indians, to waite vpon him, and serue him by
the way: and for that purpose by his commandement
were those come thither: and prayed Luys de Moscoso
to command them to be beheaded, that they might
attend and serue his Lord and brother. Luys de Moscoso
told him, that the Gouernour was not dead, but
gone to Heauen, and that of his owne Christian Souldiers,
he had taken such as he needed to serue him, and
prayed him to command those Indians to be loosed,
and not to vse any such bad custome from thenceforth."

<i>Indian High Priest. "Old prophecies foretell our fall at hand.

</p>

<p>
De Soto's invasion of Florida is, we think, most memorable
for what it has preserved touching the manners
and customs of the Indians with whom the Spaniards
dealt in such evil sort. In this light only has it historic
value. Though incomplete as to details it is our earliest
portrait of this singular people, as they existed a full
century before New England was settled, and so marks
a definite limit of history whence to date that knowledge
from.
</p>

<p>
Yet when we shall have gone so far back in the history
of this primitive race as the beginning of the sixteenth
century, nothing is found in their manners,
customs or traditions, as they have come down to us,
which would go to confirm the theory that the ancestors
of these people were more civilized than themselves.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_21' name='Page_21' href='#Page_21'>21</a></span>
The little they seem to have known about it belongs to
the very infancy of art, not to its growth out of lower
conditions. These Indians knew how to make beads of
the pearl oyster. So did those of New England know
how to make shell wampum. The Florida Indians
could weave cloth of the fibre of
wild hemp and dye it prettily;
they could tan, dress, and decorate
deerskins; had found out
how to mould rude earthen vessels
and bake them in the sun.
In some of these things they certainly
surpassed their brethren of
New England, though their arms
and implements are quite like
those used farther north. Then
inasmuch as all the tools they had
to work with were of the rudest
sort, being shaped out
of stone or bone, so the
making of most things
cost them a great deal
of time and labor, and
hence the mechanical
arts in use among them
were such only as spring
from the first and most pressing wants of a people, as is
everywhere the case in the history of primitive man.<a name='FA_18' id='FA_18' href='#FN_18' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a>

</div>

<p>
It must be borne in mind that what we are told
about these Florida Indians is written by their enemies.
Therefore, when their courage is praised, we feel that
they must have deserved it. Perhaps what most astonishes
us about the narratives themselves is the cold-blooded
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_22' name='Page_22' href='#Page_22'>22</a></span>
way in which they recount the slaughter made
of these Indians, who seem hardly to have been considered
in the light of human beings.
</p>

<p>
It would seem as if the ill-repute of the Spaniards
must have gone before them, for upon nearing the
Florida shore the invaders saw smokes everywhere curling
above it, which they soon found were lighted for the
purpose of warning the inhabitants to be on their guard.
</p>

<p>
The first Indians met with were instantly set upon by
De Soto's horsemen, who had nearly killed John Ortiz
before they discovered him to be a Christian like themselves.
Though in doubt what the landing of so many
white men could mean, these Indians were loyally
bringing Ortiz as a peace-offering to the Spanish camp.
It is worth while to remember this, since on the part
of the Spaniards the first act was one of violence and
intimidation.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, whenever the Spaniards approached an
Indian town, the inhabitants fled from it in terror; and
so in order to procure guides to lead them, or porters to
carry the baggage, while on the march, De Soto found
himself obliged to seize by force such Indians as his
own men could lay hands upon. On these he put
chains and caused them to bear the burdens of his soldiers.
If possible, a chief was kidnapped to be held a
hostage for the good conduct of his tribe. No Spaniard
was therefore safe outside his encampment.<a name='FA_19' id='FA_19' href='#FN_19' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a>
</p>

<p>
Again, the Spaniards plundered the villages they
entered of whatever they stood in need, just the same
as if they were in a conquered country. If they
wanted corn they took it; if they found any thing of
value they helped themselves, without making any
show of paying for it. In consequence, the exasperated
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_23' name='Page_23' href='#Page_23'>23</a></span>
Indians everywhere obstructed De Soto's march so far
as it lay in their power to do so; and on the other
hand, in proportion to the resistance he met with, De
Soto treated the natives with greater or less severity.
We know these Indians therefore, for men of courage,
since in defence of their homes and liberties they could
fight with naked breasts against men in armor, and with
bows and arrows against fire-arms.<a name='FA_20' id='FA_20' href='#FN_20' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a>
</p>

<p class="caption">PALISADED TOWN.</p>
</div>

<p>
So that by the time De Soto arrived at the Mississippi,
he had lost over a hundred men and most of his horses.
</p>

<p>
What such treatment would be likely to lead to is
easily foreseen. Most surely it sowed the seeds of
future hostility to the white man broadcast. His cruelty
became a tradition. The Indian has a long memory
and is by nature revengeful. From having looked
upon the whites as gods, gifted with all good and
beneficent things, the Indian quickly perceived them to
be a cruel people filled with avarice, and bent on destroying
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_24' name='Page_24' href='#Page_24'>24</a></span>
him. His worst enemies could do no more.
And thus the two races met each other in the New World.
</p>

<p>
We should not omit to mention here one of the
strangest things that fell out in the whole course of the
expedition. When the Spaniards came to the town of
Quizaquiz, where they made some stay, Indians flocked
there from distant villages in order to see for themselves
what manner of people had come among them;
for they said it had been foretold them by their fathers'
fathers that men with white faces should come and subdue
them, and now
they believed
the prophecy
had come true.

<p class="caption">A FLORIDA INDIAN'S CABIN.</p>
</div>

<p>
In appearance,
the Indian
villages
and towns
we're everywhere
much
the same. The
houses were little round cabins, built of wooden palings,
sometimes thatched with palm leaves, sometimes with
canes or reeds laid on the roof in the manner of tiles.
The better to resist the fierce Gulf winds, they were
built low on the ground. In the colder climates, the
walls would be smeared over with clay. The only
difference to be perceived between the cabins of the
common sort and the dwellings of the chief men was
that they were larger and more roomy residences, with
sometimes a gallery built out over the front, under
which the family could sit in the heat of the day.
</p>

<p>
Every little knot of cabins would have one or more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_25' name='Page_25' href='#Page_25'>25</a></span>
corn-cribs close beside it. This was a loft or granary
set up in the air on poles, exactly in the manner now
practised by the whites, and for the like purpose of
storing up maize or Indian corn which was universally
cultivated. Only for the supplies of maize everywhere
found, both the Spaniards and their horses would soon
have starved, as corn<a name='FA_21' id='FA_21' href='#FN_21' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> became their only article of food,
and ofttimes they had to go hungry for want of it.
</p>

<p class="caption">MAKING A CANOE.</p>
</div>

<p>
Men and women wore mantles woven either of the
bark of trees or of a wild sort of hemp which the
Indians knew how to dress properly for the purpose.
They also understood the art of tanning and dyeing
such skins as were obtained in the chase, which they
also made up into garments. Two of these mantles
made a woman's usual dress. One was worn about
them, hanging from the waist down, like a petticoat or
gown, the other would be thrown over the left shoulder
with the right arm bared, after the manner of the Egyptians.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_26' name='Page_26' href='#Page_26'>26</a></span>
The warriors wore only this last mantle, which
allowed them free use of the right arm in drawing forth
an arrow from the quiver, or in bending the bow.
When dressed up in his head-gear of feathers, and wearing
his ornamented mantle flung across his shoulder,
bow in hand, and carrying his well-filled quiver at his
back, the Indian warrior made no unpicturesque figure,
even beside the heavily-armed white man, for he was of
a well-proportioned and muscular build, with good features,
an eye like the eagle's, and a bearing which told
of the manhood throbbing beneath his dusky skin.

<p>
The Indians of
Florida worshipped
both a
god of good and
evil. They also
made sacrifice to
both spirits alike.
In some places
they worshipped and sacrificed to the sun as the great
life-giving principle; in others they had a curious custom
when any great lord died, of sacrificing living
persons to appease or comfort his spirit with the offering
of these other spirits who were to serve him and
bear him company in the happy hunting-grounds.
</p>

<p>
Some tribes kept their dead unburied for a certain
time in a rude sort of pantheon, or temple, dedicated to
their gods.<a name='FA_22' id='FA_22' href='#FN_22' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> Over this a strict watch was kept to guard
against the intrusion of evil spirits who were supposed
to lie in wait, in the form of some prowling beast of
prey. This custom sprung from a belief that the spirits
of the dead revisited their mortal bodies at times.
</p>

<p>
Besides maize, pumpkins, beans, and melons, whatever
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_27' name='Page_27' href='#Page_27'>27</a></span>
natural fruits the country produced the Indian
lived on. He hunted and fished. The summer was his
season of plenty, the winter one of want, sometimes
of distress, but in the semi-tropical region, bordering
upon the Gulf, his wants were fewer and more easily
supplied, and hence, as a rule,
life was freer from hardship
than in more northern climes.

The stronger nations made war
upon the weaker, but treaties
were duly respected. The vanquished
were compelled to pay
tribute to the conquerors or join
themselves with some stronger
tribe than their own. The languages
differed so much with
different nations, that De Soto
found he must have a new interpreter
for every new nation
he visited; nevertheless the Indians
quickly learned to speak
the Spanish tongue. In public the
people behaved with great propriety,
showed respect for their
rulers, and often confounded De
Soto, who pretended to supernatural
powers, by the shrewdness of their replies.
For instance, when the Spaniard gave out that he was
the child of the sun, a Natchez chief promptly bid him
dry up the river, and he would believe him. In some
places the Indians greeted the Spaniards with songs
and music. Their instruments were reeds hung with
tinkling balls of gold or silver. When the chieftain, or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_28' name='Page_28' href='#Page_28'>28</a></span>
cacique, went abroad in state, men walked by his side
carrying screens elegantly made of the bright plumage
of birds. These were borne at the end of a long staff.
</p>

<p>
The Spaniards found the fertile parts of the country
everywhere crowded with towns, and very populous.
But they did not find the gold<a name='FA_23' id='FA_23' href='#FN_23' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a> they coveted so much.
They called the Indians a people ignorant of all the
blessings of civilization, but to their honor be it also
said, they were free from the vices by which it is
accompanied and degraded.

In the disasters of Narvaez and De Soto, the movement
from the side of Florida towards the West had met with
an untimely check. But, strangely enough, it made progress
in another quarter through these very misfortunes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_29' name='Page_29' href='#Page_29'>29</a></span>
</p>

<p>
For while De Soto was vainly seeking for gold on
that side, his countrymen were bestirring themselves
in the same business in a quite different direction, as
we shall see.

<p class="caption">ROCK INSCRIPTIONS, NEW MEXICO.</p>
</div>

<p>
At this time it was Don Antonio de Mendoza who
was the emperor's viceroy in Mexico. Now Mendoza
aimed to gain distinction with his sovereign by being the
first who should discover and make known to the world,
all the unexplored region lying north of Mexico, which
was accounted as rich as any yet known to the Spaniards.
Most of all, perhaps, Mendoza wished to find the
land's end in that northern direction, as by doing so he
would complete the work of putting a girdle round the
continent, and gain the glory of it for himself.
</p>

<p>
Various efforts were making to do this both by land
and sea.<a name='FA_24' id='FA_24' href='#FN_24' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> And curiously enough these efforts came
from the West.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_30' name='Page_30' href='#Page_30'>30</a></span>
</p>

<p>
For the purpose in hand Mendoza had with him in
Mexico two or three survivors<a name='FA_25' id='FA_25' href='#FN_25' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> of Narvaez' expedition,
who, in the most wonderful manner, had made their
way overland through the unknown regions of the
North, from Florida into Mexico. These men told
the viceroy, Mendoza, that the natives who dwelt among
the mountains to the north were a very rich people,
who lived in great cities and had gold and silver in
abundance. Mendoza also held captive some Indians
whose homes were in that far-away country, which he
was now meditating how to conquer.
</p>

<p>
Yet two important obstacles met Mendoza at the
start. In the first place, the unknown country, which
the Spaniards vaguely knew by the name of Cibola,<a name='FA_26' id='FA_26' href='#FN_26' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a>
could be reached only through mountain defiles, so
rugged and inaccessible that men questioned whether it
could be reached at all. Nature had admirably adapted
it for defence. Clearly, then, a few resolute men might
easily defend their country against a host, and the
Spaniards having reason to expect the most determined
resistance found a twofold hinderance in their way.
</p>

<p>
The second obstacle, the Spaniards had created for
themselves, by making slaves of all natives taken in
arms. Rather than be slaves the Indians had fled into
the mountain fastnesses. As their fear of the Spaniards
was very great, these fugitives secreted themselves
in the most inaccessible places, choosing rather to live
like wild beasts than be branded like cattle with hot
irons, and nursing their hatred of their oppressors.
Not venturing to come down into the open valleys
where they would be at the mercy of their conquerors,
these unhappy people lived in caves, or in stone dwellings
perched high among the rocks, where they could
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_31' name='Page_31' href='#Page_31'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_32' name='Page_32' href='#Page_32'>32</a></span>
at least breathe the air of liberty unmolested. Those
who formerly lived in the valleys had also fled to the
mountains when they heard of the Spaniards' coming.
So the Spaniards would have to contend not only with
nature, but with a brave and a hostile people, if they
attempted to subdue them.
</p>

<img src="images/i-042.jpg" width="381" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">NEW MEXICO.—ROUTE OF SPANISH INVADERS.</p>
</div>

<p>
Considering that great difficulties are often overcome
or results accomplished by simple means, the viceroy
took a poor barefooted friar<a name='FA_27' id='FA_27' href='#FN_27' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> from his cell, gave him
one of Narvaez' men for a guide, and with a few
natives of the country sent him out to explore the
unknown wilds. Upon reaching Culiacan, which was
the most northerly place the Spaniards had made their
way to, the captive Indians were sent ahead with messages
of peace and good-will to the distrustful natives,
who took good care to keep out of the way.
</p>

<p>
These promises of peace induced a great many of the
natives to come down from the mountains; and once
there they were easily won over with gifts and kind
words, and in gratitude for the promise not to capture
and enslave them as they had done, told the Spaniards to
go and come as freely as they chose. The natives were
then sent home to spread the news among their brethren.
</p>

<p>
The way being thus opened, the friar and his party
set forth by one route, while still another party, led by
Vasquez de Coronado,<a name='FA_28' id='FA_28' href='#FN_28' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> went forward by a different one,
on the same errand. Of the two parties, that of the
friar alone succeeded in penetrating far into the country,
and the information he brought back now reads
more like a story from the Arabian Nights than the
sober record of one already well versed in the country
and people, such as Mendoza says he believed Father
Marco to be. Yet the father is thought to have reached
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_33' name='Page_33' href='#Page_33'>33</a></span>
Cibola, or Zuñi, which was the object of his journey,
when the murder of his negro guide caused him to
hasten back with all speed to the Spanish settlements.
</p>

<p>
So these attempts, as well as a second made by
Coronado in the following year, were fruitless in every
thing except the formal act of taking possession of the
country, and the acquisition of some imperfect geographical
knowledge about the valleys of the Colorado,<a name='FA_29' id='FA_29' href='#FN_29' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a>
the Gila,<a name='FA_30' id='FA_30' href='#FN_30' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a> and the Rio Grande del Norte.<a name='FA_31' id='FA_31' href='#FN_31' class='fnanchor'>[8]</a> About all
we can say of them is that the explorers went through
the country.
</p>

<p>
As in Florida, so here a long period of inaction followed
these failures. In both cases the Spaniards had
come and seen, but not conquered. The Mississippi
flowed on untroubled to the sea, the heart of the continent
still kept its secret fast locked in the bosom of
its hills. But we know now that the gold and silver
the Spaniards craved so much to possess were there
waiting for the more successful explorers.
</p>

<p>
It is forty years before we again hear of any serious
effort made to search out the secrets of this land of
mystery. The Church then took the matter in hand.
It was wisely decided that the best way to conquer the
people was to convert them. Accordingly two pious
Franciscans set out from the Spanish settlements in
New Biscay<a name='FA_32' id='FA_32' href='#FN_32' class='fnanchor'>[9]</a> on this errand. This time they penetrated
into the country by the valley of the Rio Grande, under
protection of a few soldiers, who, after conducting the
fathers to a remote part of this valley, left them to
pursue their pious work alone, and themselves returned
to New Biscay. Hearing nothing from these missionaries,
those who had sent them fitted out an expedition
in the following year—1582—to go in search of them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_34' name='Page_34' href='#Page_34'>34</a></span>
This rescuing party brought back a more exact knowledge
of the country and people than had so far been
obtained through all the many explorers put together.
</p>

<p class="caption">JUNCTION OF THE GILA AND COLORADO.</p>
</div>

<p>
In proportion as they advanced up the Rio Grande,
these explorers found everywhere very populous towns.
The people lived well and contentedly. Some were
found who had even kept the faith taught them by
Christians,<a name='FA_33' id='FA_33' href='#FN_33' class='fnanchor'>[10]</a> long ago, but in general they worshipped
idols in temples built for the purpose. In the natives
themselves the Spaniards remarked a wide difference.
Some went almost naked, and lived in poor hovels of
mud covered with straw thatch. Others, again, would
be clothed in skins, and live in houses four stories high.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_35' name='Page_35' href='#Page_35'>35</a></span>
Often the natives showed the Spaniards cotton mantles
skilfully woven in stripes of white and blue, of their
own making and dyeing, which were much admired.
It seemed for the most part a land of thrift and plenty,
for the towns were populous beyond any thing the Spaniards
had ever dreamed of. And the farther north the
explorers went, the better the condition of the people
became. Finding themselves in a land much like Old
Mexico, in respect of its mountains, rivers, and forests,
the explorers gave it the name of New Mexico.
</p>

<p>
One of the greatest towns visited, called Acoma,<a name='FA_34' id='FA_34' href='#FN_34' class='fnanchor'>[11]</a>
contained above six thousand persons. It was built
upon the level top of a high cliff, with no other way of
access to it than by steps hewn out of the solid rock
which formed the cliff. The sight of this place made
the Spaniards wonder not a little at the skill and foresight
shown in planning and building these natural
fortresses, which nothing but famine could conquer.
All the water was kept in cisterns. But this was not
all the aptitude these people showed in overcoming
obstacles or supplying needs. Their cornfields lay at
some distance from the town. In this country it hardly
ever rains. So the want of rain to make the corn grow
was supplied by digging ditches to bring the water from
a neighboring stream into the fields. We therefore see
how conditions of soil and climate had taught the
Indians the uses of irrigation.<a name='FA_35' id='FA_35' href='#FN_35' class='fnanchor'>[12]</a>
</p>

<p>
Turning out of the valley of the Rio Grande, to the
west, the explorers at length came to the province of
Zuñi, where many Spanish crosses were found standing
just as Coronado had left them forty years before.
Here our Spaniards heard of a very great lake, situated
at a great distance, where a people dwelt who wore bracelets
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_36' name='Page_36' href='#Page_36'>36</a></span>
and earrings of gold. Part of the company were
desirous of going thither at once, but the rest wished to
return into New Biscay in order to give an account of
all they had seen and heard. So only the leader with a
few men went forward, meeting everywhere good treatment
from the natives, who in one place, we are told,
showered down meal before the Spaniards, for their
horses to tread upon, feasting and caressing their strange
visitors as long as they remained among them.
</p>

<p>
These explorers returned to Old Mexico in July,
1583, by the valley of the Pecos,<a name='FA_36' id='FA_36' href='#FN_36' class='fnanchor'>[13]</a> to which stream they
gave the name of River of Oxen, because they saw
great herds of bison<a name='FA_37' id='FA_37' href='#FN_37' class='fnanchor'>[14]</a> feeding all along its course.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_37' name='Page_37' href='#Page_37'>37</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Out of these discoveries and reports came new
attempts to plant a colony on the Rio Grande. Nothing
prospered, however, until 1598, when Juan de
Oñate<a name='FA_38' id='FA_38' href='#FN_38' class='fnanchor'>[15]</a> invaded New Mexico at the head of a force
meant to thoroughly subdue and permanently hold
it. Oñate was named governor under the viceroy.
These Spaniards established themselves on the Rio
Grande, not far from where Santa Fé now is. Most of
the village Indians submitted themselves to the Spaniards,
whose authority over them was, at best, little
more than nominal, though the roving tribes, the fierce
Apaches and warlike Navajoes, never forgot their
hereditary hatred to the Spaniards, with whom they
kept up an incessant warfare.
</p>

<p>
With this expedition came a number of Franciscan
missionaries who, as soon as a town was gained over,
established a mission for the conversion of the natives.
In 1601 Santa Fé was founded and made the capital.
In thirty years more the Catholic clergy had established
as many as fifty missions which gave religious instruction
to ninety towns and villages.
</p>

<p>
New Mexico had now reached her period of greatest
prosperity under Spanish rule. For fifty years more
the country rather stood still than made progress. The
Spaniards were too overbearing, and the old hostility
too deep, for peace to endure. Then, the system of
bondage which the Spaniards brought with them from
Old Mexico, and most unwisely put in practice here,
bore its usual bitter fruit. Determined to be slaves no
longer, in 1680 the native New Mexicans rose in a
body, and drove the invaders out of the country with
great slaughter. Upon the frontier of Old Mexico the
fugitives halted, and then founded El Paso del Norte,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_38' name='Page_38' href='#Page_38'>38</a></span>
which they considered the gateway to New Mexico, and
so named it. It took the Spaniards twelve years to
recover from this blow. By that time little was left
to show they had ever been masters of New Mexico.
But a new invasion took place, concerning which few
details remain, though we do know it resulted in a
permanent conquest before the end of the century.

<p>
As far back as 1687 Father Kino had founded a mission
on the skirt of the country lying round the head of
the Gulf of California, to which the Spaniards gave the
name of Pimeria.<a name='FA_39' id='FA_39' href='#FN_39' class='fnanchor'>[16]</a> It will be noticed that once again
they were following up the traces of Father Marco and
Coronado. When the Spaniards took courage after this
defeat, and again entered New Mexico, Kino (1693)
founded other missions in the Gila country which in
time grew to be connecting links between New Mexico
and California, in what is now Arizona.<a name='FA_40' id='FA_40' href='#FN_40' class='fnanchor'>[17]</a>

"THE MARVELLOUS COUNTRY."
</h4>

<p class="blockquot">
"<i>Antiquity here lives, speaks, and cries out to the traveller, Sta, viator.</i>"—<i>V.
Hugo, The Rhine.</i>
</p>

<p>
Mention has been made of the towns which the
Spaniards came to in the course of their marchings up
and down the country. Men had told them, in all
soberness, that far away in the north-west seven flourishing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_40' name='Page_40' href='#Page_40'>40</a></span>
cities,<a name='FA_41' id='FA_41' href='#FN_41' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> wondrous great and rich, lay hid among
the mountains. We remember that their first expeditions
were planned to reach these seven cities. Now,
when, at last, the Spaniards did come to them, these
wonderful cities proved to be large, but not rich, full
of people, though by no means such as the white men
expected to see there.
</p>

<p>
Though sorely vexed to think they had come so far
to find so little, the Spaniards were very much astonished
by the appearance of these cities, the like of
which they had never seen before. So these cities hid
away among desert mountains were long remembered
and often talked about.
</p>

<p>
But these cities were not cities at all, as the term is
now understood. Instead of many houses spread out
over much ground, the builders plainly aimed at putting
a great many people into a little space. Yet the cities
they built were neither simply walled towns, nor simply
fortresses, but a skilful combination of both.
</p>

<p>
In the open plain they commonly consisted of one
great structure either enclosed by a high wall, or else
so built round it that wall and building were one.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, if the pueblo<a name='FA_42' id='FA_42' href='#FN_42' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> stood upon a height,
the houses would be built all in blocks, and have streets
running through them, though in other respects the
manner of building was everywhere the same.
</p>

<p>
In either case, this style of architecture made them
look less like the peaceful abodes of peaceful men,
than the strongholds of a warlike and predatory race,
whence the inmates might sally forth upon their weaker
neighbors, just as the lords of feudal times did from
the rock-built castles of the Rhine. It is plain they
had grown up out of the necessity for defence, as every
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_41' name='Page_41' href='#Page_41'>41</a></span>
thing else was sacrificed to its demands, and we know
that necessity is the mother of invention.
</p>

<p>
The single great house, in which all the inhabitants
lived together, is perhaps the most curious. Let us
suppose this to be a three-story building, parted off into
from sixty to a hundred little rooms, with something
like a thousand people living in it. Could the outer
wall be taken away, the whole edifice would look like a
monstrous honeycomb, and in fact the pueblo was nothing
else than a human hive, as we shall presently see.
</p>

<p class="caption">A PUEBLO RESTORED.</p>
</div>

<p>
Now the city of Acoma is one of those which are
built upon a height. The builders chose the flat top
of a barren sandstone cliff, containing about ten acres,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_42' name='Page_42' href='#Page_42'>42</a></span>
which rises about three hundred feet above the plain.
In New Mexico such table-lands are called <i>mesas</i>, from
<i>mesa</i>, the Spanish word meaning table. Therefore,
while no one knows its age, or history, all agree that
Acoma must go far back into the past. Acoma was so
strongly built that to-day it looks hardly different from
what it did when the Spaniards first saw it, perched on
the top of its rock, in 1582.
</p>

<p>
We see then in the builders of Acoma a people gifted
with a much higher order of intelligence than the Red
Indian, who is always found living in huts, or hovels,
of the rudest possible kind. The wild Indian always
carries his house about with him, and so is ever ready,
at a moment's notice, to
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Fold his tent, like the Arabs,</p>
<p>And as silently steal away."</p>
</div></div>

<p>
The sedentary Indian sometimes patterned his after the
burrowing animals, like the beaver, and sometimes after
the birds of the air, like the sparrow.
</p>

<p>
Now to describe Acoma itself. It consists of ranges
of massive buildings rising in successive tiers from the
ground. The second story is set a little back from
the first, and the third a little back from the second, so
leaving a space in front of each range of buildings for
the inhabitants or sentinels to walk about in, in peaceful
times, or send down missiles upon the heads of their
enemies in time of war. By running up the outer wall
of each story, for a few feet higher than this platform,
the builders made what is called a parapet in military
phrase, meant for the protection of the defenders. There
were no doors or windows except in the topmost tier.
Acoma, then, was a castle built upon a rock.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_43' name='Page_43' href='#Page_43'>43</a></span>
</p>

<p>
It would seem that only birds of the air or creeping
things could gain admittance to such a place. Indeed,
there was no other way for the inhabitants themselves
to enter their dwellings except by climbing up ladders
set against the outer walls of the building for the purpose.
In this manner one could climb to the first platform,
then to the second, but could not get in till he
came to the roof, through which he descended by a trap
door into his own quarters.

<p class="caption">ACOMA.</p>
</div>

<p>
The whole collection of buildings being divided by
partition walls into several blocks, each containing sixty
or seventy houses, is, practically, the apartment hotel of
to-day. The material commonly used was adobe,<a name='FA_43' id='FA_43' href='#FN_43' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> or
bricks dried and hardened in the sun. Such a building
could not be set on fire or its walls battered down with
any missiles known to its time.
</p>

<p>
We see then that the Pueblo Indians must have had
enemies whom they feared,—enemies at once aggressive,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_44' name='Page_44' href='#Page_44'>44</a></span>
warlike, and probably much more numerous than
themselves. How well they were able to meet these
conditions, their houses show us to this day.

<p>
Living remote from the whites, these people, like
those of Old Zuñi, have kept more of their primitive
manners, and live more as their fathers did, than those
do who inhabit the pueblos of the Rio Grande, where
they have been longer in contact with Europeans.
Forty years ago they knew only a few Spanish words,
which they had learned when Spaniards held their
country. In a remarkable manner, the people have
kept their own tongue and nationality free from foreign
taint. From this fact we are led to think them much
the same people that they were long, long ago.

<p>
There are other buildings in the country of the Gila,
called <i>Casas Grandes</i>,<a name='FA_44' id='FA_44' href='#FN_44' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> or Great Houses, which are
quite different from those described in this chapter, but
were apparently built for a similar purpose of defence.

<h4>
FOLK LORE OF THE PUEBLOS.
</h4>

<p>
While professing Christianity, the Pueblo Indians
have mostly kept some part of the idolatrous faith of
their fathers. Thus the two have become curiously
blended in their worship. We often see the crucifix,
or pictures of the Virgin hanging on the walls of their
dwellings, but neither the coming of the whites, nor
the zeal of missionaries could wholly eradicate the
deeply grounded foundations of their ancient religion.
The little we know about this belief, in its purity,
comes to us chiefly in the form of legendary lore,
although since the Zuñi have been studied<a name='FA_45' id='FA_45' href='#FN_45' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> with this
object we have a much clearer conception of it than
ever before.
</p>

<p>
By this uncertain light we find it to be a religion
of symbols and mysteries, primarily founded upon the
wondrous workings of nature for man's needs, and so
embodying philosophy growing out of her varied
phenomena. Therefore sun, moon, and stars, earth,
sky, and sea, and all plants, animals, and men were supposed
to bear a certain mystical relation to each other
in the plan of the universe. Instead of one all-supreme
being, the Zuñi worshipped many gods each of whom
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_46' name='Page_46' href='#Page_46'>46</a></span>
was supposed to possess some special attribute or power.
Some were higher, some lower down in the scale of
power.
</p>

<p>
The phenomena of nature, being more mysterious,
were thought to be more closely related to the higher
gods. If there was drought in the land, the priests
prayed for rain from the housetops, as the Prophet
Elijah did in the wilderness. Each year, in the month
of June, they went up to the top of the highest mountain,
which they called the "Mother of Rain," to perform
some secret ceremony touching the coming harvest.
And because rain seldom falls in this country, they
made earnest supplication to water, as a beneficent
spirit, who ascended and descended the heavens in their
sight, and to the sun as the twin deity in whom lay the
power of life and death,—to ripen the harvest or wither
all living things away into dust.
</p>

<p>
Like the ancient Egyptians, of whom they constantly
remind us, the Zuñi believed animals possessed certain
mystic powers, not belonging to man, so investing them
with a sacred character. Beasts of prey were supposed
to have magic power over other animals, hence the bear
stood higher in the Zuñi mythology than the deer or
antelope. The Indians call this magic power medicine,
but the Zuñi gave it form to his own mind—the substance
of a thing unseen—by making a stone image of
the particular animal he had chosen for his medicine,
which he carried with him to war or the chase as a
charm of highest virtue. We call this fetich-worship.
</p>

<p>
Each pueblo had one or more close, underground
cells<a name='FA_46' id='FA_46' href='#FN_46' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> in which certain mysterious rites, connected, it
is believed, with the worship of the people, were solemnized.
We are told that, at Pecos, the priests kept
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_47' name='Page_47' href='#Page_47'>47</a></span>
watch night and day over a sacred fire, which was never
suffered to go out for a single moment, for fear some
calamity would instantly happen to the tribe. It is
also said that when Pecos was assaulted and sacked by
a hostile tribe, the priests kept their charge over the
sacred fire while the tumult of battle raged about
them. And when, at length, the tribe itself had nearly
died out, the survivors took the sacred fire with them
to another people, beyond the mountains, where it is
kept burning as the symbol of an ever-living faith.
</p>

<img src="images/i-058.jpg" width="400" height="299" alt="" />
<p class="caption">RUINS OF PECOS.</p>
</div>

<p>
Another legend goes on to say that an enormous serpent
was kept in a den in the temple of Pecos to which
on certain occasions living men were thrown as a sacrifice.
Both legends would seem to point to Pecos as a
holy place, from which the priests gave out instruction
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_48' name='Page_48' href='#Page_48'>48</a></span>
to the people, as of old they did from the temples of
the heathen gods.
</p>

<p>
The tradition of the origin of the Zuñi, as told by
Mr. Cushing, is almost identical with that held by the
Mandans of the Upper Missouri. Each says the race
sprung from the earth itself, or rather that the first
peoples lived in darkness and misery in the bowels of
the earth, until at length they were led forth into the
light of day by two spirits sent from heaven for their
deliverance, as the Zuñi say, or by discovering a way
out for themselves, as the Mandans say.<a name='FA_47' id='FA_47' href='#FN_47' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a>
</p>

<p>
A tradition of the Pimos<a name='FA_48' id='FA_48' href='#FN_48' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> Indians makes a beautiful
goddess the founder of their race. It says that in times
long past a woman of matchless beauty resided among
the mountains near this place. All the men admired
and paid court to her. She received the tributes of
their devotion, grain, skins, etc., but gave no favors in
return. Her virtue and her determination to remain
secluded were equally firm. There came a drought
which threatened the world with famine. In their distress
the people applied to her, and she gave them corn
from her stock, and the supply seemed endless. Her
goodness was unbounded. One day as she was lying
asleep a drop of rain fell upon her and produced conception.
A son was the issue, who was the founder of
the race that built these structures.
</p>

<p>
But Montezuma<a name='FA_49' id='FA_49' href='#FN_49' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> is the patriarch, or tutelary genius,
whom all the Indians of New Mexico look to as their
coming deliverer.
</p>

<p>
One tradition runs that Montezuma was a poor shepherd
who tended sheep in the mountains. One day an
eagle came to keep him company. After a time the
eagle would run before Montezuma, and extend its
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_49' name='Page_49' href='#Page_49'>49</a></span>
wings, as if inviting him to seat himself on its back.
When at last Montezuma did so, the eagle instantly
spread its wings and flew away with him to Mexico
where Montezuma founded a great people.
</p>

<p>
Ever since then the Indians have constantly watched
for the second coming of Montezuma, and thenceforth
the eagle was held sacred,
and has become a
symbol among them. He
is to come, they say, in
the morning, at sunrise,
so at that hour people
may be seen on the
housetops looking earnestly
toward the east,
while chanting their
morning prayers, for like
the followers of Mahomet,
these people chant
hymns upon the housetops.
Although beautiful
and melodious these
chants are described as
being inexpressibly sad
and mournful.
</p>

</div>

<p>
In person the people
are well formed and
noble looking. They are honest among themselves,
hospitable to strangers, and unlike nomads, are wholly
devoted to caring for their crops and flocks. They own
many sheep. They raise corn, wheat, barley and fruit.
One pueblo raises corn and fruit, another is noted for its
pottery, while a third is known for its skill in weaving.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_50' name='Page_50' href='#Page_50'>50</a></span>
</p>

<p>
But after all, these Pueblo Indians are only barbarians
of a little higher type than common. Whenever
we look closely into their habits and manners, we are
struck with the resemblances existing among the whole
family of native tribes. If we assume them to have
known a higher civilization they have degenerated. If
we do not so assume, the
observation of three centuries
shows them to have
come to a standstill long,
long ago.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<span class="smcap">Pueblo Customs.</span>
When the harvest time
comes the people abandon
their villages in order to
go and live among their
fields, the better to watch
over them while the harvest
is being gathered in.

<p>
Grain is threshed by first spreading it out upon a
dirt floor made as hard as possible, and then letting
horses tread it out with their hoofs. It is then winnowed
in the wind.
</p>

<p>
The woman, who is grinding, kneels down before a
trough with her stone placed before her in the manner
of a laundress's wash-board. Over this stone she rubs
another as if scrubbing clothes. The primitive corn-mill
is simply a large concave stone into which another
stone is made to fit, so as to crush the grain by pressure
of the hand.
</p>

<p>
The unfermented dough is rolled out thin so that
after baking it may be put up in rolls, like paper. It
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_51' name='Page_51' href='#Page_51'>51</a></span>
is then the color of a hornet's nest, which indeed it resembles.
Ovens, for baking, are kept on the housetops.
</p>

<p>
The processes of spinning and weaving, than which
nothing could be more primitive, are thus described by
Lieut. Emory, as he saw it done on the Gila, in 1846.
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"A woman was seated on the ground under one of the cotton
sheds. Her left leg was turned under with the sole of the foot
upward. Between her great toe and the next a spindle, about
eighteen inches long, with a single fly, was put. Ever and anon
she gave it a dexterous twist, and at its end a coarse cotton thread
would be drawn out. This was their spinning machine. Led on
by this primitive display, I asked for their loom, pointing first to
the thread, and then to the blanket girded about the woman's
loins. A fellow who was stretched out in the dust, sunning himself,
rose lazily up, and untied a bundle which I had supposed to
be his bow and arrows. This little package, with four stakes in
the ground, was the loom. He stretched his cloth and began the
process of weaving."
</p>

<p>
But these self-taught weavers were behind their
brethren of the pueblos, whose loom was of a more
improved pattern. One
end of the frame of sticks,
on which the warp was
stretched, would be fastened
to the floor, and the
other to a rafter overhead.
The weaver sat before this
frame, rapidly moving the
shuttle in her hand to and
fro, and so forming the
woof.
</p>

<p class="caption">HIEROGLYPHICS, GILA VALLEY.</p>
</div>

<p>
Pottery was in common
use among them as far back as we have any account
of the Pueblo Indians. Jars for carrying and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_52' name='Page_52' href='#Page_52'>52</a></span>
holding water were always articles of prime necessity,
though baskets of wicker-work were sometimes woven
water-tight for the purpose.
</p>

<p class="p2">
<span class="smcap">Pueblo Government.</span> Each pueblo is under the
control of a head chief, chosen from among the people
themselves. When any public business is to be transacted,
he collects the principal chiefs in the underground
cell, previously mentioned, where the matter
that has brought them together is discussed and settled.
</p>

<p>
The pueblos also have officers, corresponding with
the mayor and constables<a name='FA_50' id='FA_50' href='#FN_50' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a> of a city, whose business it
is to preserve order. In every pueblo there is also a
public crier who shouts from the housetops such things
as it may concern the people at large to know.
</p>

<p>
In some of the pueblos there is an abandoned Spanish
mission church of unknown antiquity. The one at
Acoma has a tower forty feet high with two bells in it,
one of which is lettered "San Pedro, A.D. 1710." The
church at Pecos is a picturesque ruin.

<h4>
LAST DAYS OF CHARLES V. AND PHILIP II.
</h4>

<p>
We have here reached the high-water-mark of Spanish
advance into territory now embraced within the
United States. The moment seems well chosen in
which to take a parting look at the two great men of
their age, whose talents and energy had builded an
empire so vast that, when the master-hand was taken
away, it tottered to its fall.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Last Days of Charles V.</span> Charles V. is thought
to have hastened his death by the indulgence of so
strange a whim, that one is led to doubt the soundness
of his intellect.
</p>

<p>
He chose, now in his lifetime, to have his own funeral
obsequies performed. For the purpose he laid himself
down in his coffin which the monks then lifted on their
shoulders and bore into the church. When the bearers
had set the coffin down in front of the altar, the solemn
service for the dead was chanted, the Emperor himself
joining in all the prayers said for the repose of his soul.
In the hush which followed the last office paid to the
illustrious dead, all the attending monks passed silently
out of the church, leaving Charles to pray alone in his
coffin.
</p>

<p>
"The chamber in the Escurial Palace where Philip
II. died is that in which he passed the three last years
of his life, nailed by the gout to a sofa. Through a
narrow casement, his alcove commanded a view of the
high altar of the chapel. In this manner, without
rising, without quitting his bed, he assisted every day
at the holy sacrifice of the mass. His ministers came
to work with him in this little chamber, and they still
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_54' name='Page_54' href='#Page_54'>54</a></span>
show the little wooden board which the king made use
of when writing, or signing his name, by placing it
upon his knees."
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Tombs of Charles and Philip.</span> "At the right and
left of the altar, at the height of about fifteen feet, are
two large parallel niches hollowed out in the form of a
square. The one at the left is the tomb of Charles V.,
that at the right of Philip II. At the side of Philip II.,
who is on his knees in the attitude of prayer, are the
prince, Don Carlos, and the two queens whom Philip
successively espoused, all three also on their knees in
prayer. Underneath, one may read in letters of gold:

<p>

SWORD AND GOWN IN CALIFORNIA.
</h4>

<p>
California is the name<a name='FA_51' id='FA_51' href='#FN_51' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> given in an old Spanish
romance to a fabulous island of the sea lying out
toward the Indies.
</p>

<p>
After a time, the Spaniards
found out that
what they had supposed
to be a large island<a name='FA_52' id='FA_52' href='#FN_52' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> was
really a peninsula, so the
name presently spread
to the mainland.
</p>

<p>
Cabrillo<a name='FA_53' id='FA_53' href='#FN_53' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> sailed yet
higher up, and others
higher still, till the work
of tracing the coast as
far as Cape Mendocino<a name='FA_54' id='FA_54' href='#FN_54' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a>
itself was completed.

</div>

<p>
Spanish power in the
New World received
now and here its first
serious check, though
possibly little was
thought of it at the
time, in Europe. Like
David before Goliath,
little England confronted
the bully of Europe
where least expected, with menace to her great and
growing empire of the West.
</p>

<p>
The greatest seaman of his age, Francis Drake, whose
name was the terror of Spaniards everywhere, had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_56' name='Page_56' href='#Page_56'>56</a></span>
passed the Straits of Magellan with one little vessel,
into the Great South Sea, which Balboa discovered and
claimed for Spain. Stopping at no odds, one day fighting
and the next plundering, Drake kept his undaunted
way a thousand leagues up the coast. His ship being
already full-freighted with the plunder of the ports at
which she had called, Drake thought to shorten the
way back to England by sailing through the North-east
Passage,<a name='FA_55' id='FA_55' href='#FN_55' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> so outwitting the Spaniards who were keeping
vigilant watch against his return southward,—for his
men were but a handful against a world of foes, and
his ship too precious to be risked in fight. So Drake
sailed on into the north. He sailed as far as the Oregon
coast, when the weather grew so cold that his men,
who were come from tropic heats, began to murmur.
Drake was therefore forced to put his ship about and
steer south again, along the coast, looking for a harbor
as he went, to refit his ship in. Finding this harbor<a name='FA_56' id='FA_56' href='#FN_56' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a> in
38°, the Golden Hind dropped anchor there on the 17th
of June, 1579, showing a flag which had never before
been seen in that part of the world.
</p>

<p>
Drake lay quietly at anchor in this port for five
weeks. During all this time the natives came in troops
to the shore, drawn thither to see the strange bearded
white men who spoke in an unknown tongue, and
kept the loud thunder hid away in their ship. It is
even said that the king of that country took the crown
off his own head, and put it on Francis Drake's in
token of submission. All this and much else is fully
and quaintly set forth in the narrative of Master
Fletcher, who was Drake's chaplain on board the
Golden Hind.
</p>

<p>
Before leaving this friendly port, Drake took formal
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_57' name='Page_57' href='#Page_57'>57</a></span>
possession of the country by setting up a post, to which
a plate of brass was fixed, with Queen Elizabeth's name
engraved on it.
</p>

<p>
The white cliffs of the coast that rose about him,
would seem to have recalled to Drake's mind those of
Old England, for he gave the name of New Albion to all
this great land he had merely coasted. We should not
forget that Elizabeth herself afterwards said of such
acts that "discovery is of little worth without actual
possession."

<p>
Having planted this thorn in the side of the Spanish
Empire of the West, Drake merrily sailed away for
England by way of the Cape of Good Hope.<a name='FA_57' id='FA_57' href='#FN_57' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_58' name='Page_58' href='#Page_58'>58</a></span>

<p>
Spain complained. Elizabeth listened with impatience.
When the Spanish ambassador insisted on his master's
sole right
to navigate
the western
ocean, the
Queen lost
her temper.
She roundly
told Mendoza
that "the
sea and air
are common
to all men."
Yet the
claim itself
shows what
mighty hold
Spain had
on the other
powers. In
eight years the
question was
fought out in the
English Channel
with all Europe
for spectators. Spain
was so sure of victory, that the popular
feeling even got into the nursery rhymes of the day.

<p>
Drake had perhaps done as much as any man to
bring about the issue. He was there in the thick of
the fight.<a name='FA_58' id='FA_58' href='#FN_58' class='fnanchor'>[8]</a>
</p>

<p>
So the spell of Spanish invincibility was broken at
last. Spain was no longer mistress of the seas.
</p>

<p>
Next on her brilliant roll of navigators, comes Juan
de Fuca, who (1592) discovered the straits that now
bear his name. Spain still wanting a harbor in which
the Manila galleons could refit when homeward bound,
Sebastian Vizcaino (1602-1603), sometimes called "the
Biscayner," entered the haven of San Diego, and that
of Monterey,<a name='FA_59' id='FA_59' href='#FN_59' class='fnanchor'>[9]</a> which he then named, as he also did the
one lying within Point Reyes, called by him Port San
Francisco.<a name='FA_60' id='FA_60' href='#FN_60' class='fnanchor'>[10]</a> Exploration of this coast then ceased for
a century and a half.
</p>

<p>
The real advance into California (1768), like all
other Spanish movements on this continent, originated
in a half-monkish, half-military plan for the conquest,
conversion and civilization of the country. Enough
was known of its soil and climate to show how far both
exceeded the sterile steppes of New Mexico, where
Spanish advance had already reached its farthest
limit, and like a stream that meets an obstacle in its
path, was turned into another channel. For where
plants grow and rivers flow, God has fixed the abodes
of men.
</p>

<p>
This movement began<a name='FA_61' id='FA_61' href='#FN_61' class='fnanchor'>[11]</a> from the missions of Lower
California. It was designed to extend the system by
which Spain had first conquered, and since ruled,
Mexico into the unoccupied and little-known province
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_60' name='Page_60' href='#Page_60'>60</a></span>
of Alta, or Upper, California. The viceroy was to
furnish soldiers, the president-prelate of the Franciscan
order, missionaries.
</p>

<p>
Thus coast batteries and forts were to be built for
the defence of the best harbors, as well as to sustain
the missions themselves, so forming a line of military
strength along the coast sufficient to repel assault by
sea or land, while the mountains behind them would
be a barrier
between the
missions and
the wild
tribes who
lived in the
great valleys
beyond.
One arm was
to seize upon
and firmly
hold the
country in
its grasp,
while the other should gradually bring it into subjection
to the Catholic faith. Then, with clerical rule
once established, civil order was to come in. Therefore
the first essential thing was to build a fort, and
the second a church. In this way it was proposed to
make rallying-points for civilization of these missions,<a name='FA_62' id='FA_62' href='#FN_62' class='fnanchor'>[12]</a>
although the plan founded an oligarchy and nothing
else.
</p>

<p class="caption">OLD MAP, SHOWING DRAKE'S PORT.</p>
</div>

<p>
The Spaniards did not mean to till the soil themselves,
but to make the Indians do it for them. Setting
this scheme at work, a Franciscan mission was begun
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_61' name='Page_61' href='#Page_61'>61</a></span>
at San Diego in July, 1769. The next year another
was established at Monterey. From these missions
explorers presently made their way out to the valley of
the San Joaquin, and even as far north as the great bay
of San Francisco (1772), which took to itself, a little
later, the name of the old Port San Francisco, with
which it must not be confounded.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<img src="images/i-072.jpg" width="400" height="258" alt="" />
<p class="caption">CARMEL MISSION CHURCH.</p>
</div>

<p>
In 1776 the Mission of San Francisco was founded.
Monterey being the chief settlement, the governor's
official residence was fixed there; and now, so late as
the period of American Independence, we have the
machinery for civilization in California fairly set in
motion.
</p>

<p>
The plan which the founders had proposed to themselves
also included the building-up of pueblos, which
should be located in suitable places outside the missions,
though actually meant for their support, and therefore
in a sense dependencies of them. But these pueblos
were to be inhabited by Spanish colonists only. One
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_62' name='Page_62' href='#Page_62'>62</a></span>
was thus begun (1777) at San José, and a second (1781)
at Los Angeles. Here then are plants of two distinct
types in the growth of the country,—native vassals
and foreign freemen.
</p>

<p>
As, one by one, missions were created, the native
Californians were told they must come and live in them,
and submit themselves to the fostering care of the fathers,
who would teach them how to live as the whites did,
and make known to them the blessings of Christianity, so
that their children might exceed their fathers in knowledge,
and as they were a docile, submissive and indolent
people, they mostly obeyed the order unresistingly, and
were set to work building houses, tilling the soil, or
tending flocks or herds belonging to the missions, into
which it was the aim of the fathers to draw all the
wealth of the country.
</p>

<p>
These pious fathers, however, thought more of converting
the Indian than of making a man of him. It is
true they baptized and gave him a Christian name, but
they held him in servitude all the same. The system
looked to keeping him a dependant rather than rousing
his ambitions, or showing him how he might better his
condition. For instance, the Indian could hold no land
in his own right. His labor went to enrich the mission,
not himself. He was fed and clothed from the mission.
He was a mere atom of society, a vassal of the Church,
and was so treated. Men and women were put in the
stocks or whipped at the pleasure of their masters, just
the same as in slave plantations. If an Indian ran away,
he was pursued and brought back by the military. The
missionaries found him free, but took away his liberty.
In short, spite of all the romance thrown round him,
and though his condition was somewhat better than it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_63' name='Page_63' href='#Page_63'>63</a></span>
had been in times past, yet when all is said, the mission
Indian was hardly more than a serf. Still the work of
the missions so prospered that by the end of the century
there were eighteen of them with 13,500 converts. But
at this time there were 110 more than 1,800 whites in the
country, or only one hundred to a mission.

</div>

<p>
Such, briefly, were the Spanish missions of California,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_64' name='Page_64' href='#Page_64'>64</a></span>
which undertook a noble work, not nobly done, which
kept the word of promise to the ear and broke it to the
hope.
</p>

<p>
If we look at the commercial policy of the province,
and it is what we should most naturally turn to next,
we shall find almost no business transacted with the
outside world. Once a year the Manila galleon came
to Monterey and took away the furs that had been collected
there. Spain's policy shut out all other nations
from her colonies, and to the same extent shut the colonies
in. So foreign vessels were forbid to enter her
ports at all. To this fact we owe the meagre and unfrequent
reports of what was going on in the country, nor
was it till 1786 that the world learned something of its
true condition and worth.
</p>

<p class="caption">MAP FROM ARCANO DEL MARE, 1647</p>
</div>

<p>
In that year a French discovery ship put into Monterey.
Her commander was La Peyrouse,<a name='FA_63' id='FA_63' href='#FN_63' class='fnanchor'>[13]</a> whom
Louis XVI. had sent to the Pacific to look into the
fur trade of the north-west coast, and who, after touching
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_65' name='Page_65' href='#Page_65'>65</a></span>
there, had come down the coast to refit in a Spanish
port. La Peyrouse used the six weeks of his stay
in Monterey to such purpose that we owe to him the
first and only intelligent view of California had up to
this time.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of course, communication with the neighbor
provinces was mostly carried on by sea. There
was a little trade with San Blas, and so with Old
Mexico, but it was long before the way was opened
to New Mexico by crossing the Colorado desert. One
of the fathers, in 1776, set out from San Gabriel for
the Colorado River, passing safely over the route now
followed by the Southern Pacific Railway. Afterwards,
a little trade sprung up between the provinces,
but the way was long and the road beset with
dangers.
</p>

<p>
The first American vessel to enter a California port
was the ship Otter of Boston, in 1796. She was an
armed trader, carrying a pass signed by Washington,
of whom it was doubtful if the Californians had even
so much as heard, though they admitted the Otter to
trade with them.
</p>

<p>
The Spaniards had found the natives singularly free
from the vices of civilization, but intermingling of the
two races soon led to mingling of blood, and subsequent
growth of an intermediate class half Spanish and
half Indian, so combining certain traits of both without
the native vigor of either.

<h3>
II.
<br />
THE FRENCH.
</h3>

<hr />

<h4>
PRELUDE.
</h4>

<p>
After the discovery of America by Columbus, the
French were among the first to turn their attention
to this side of the Atlantic, not so much to make conquests
in the spirit of universal dominion, as the Spaniards
were doing, as to seek new outlets or new sources
of supply for their commerce and fisheries.
</p>

<p>
Spain, as we have seen, forced other nations to follow
her lead at a respectful distance. With one foot planted
in Europe and the other in America, she bestrode the
Atlantic as the colossus of the age.
</p>

<p>
But the newly awakened spirit of discovery would
not down at the bidding of prince or pontiff, let him be
never so great or so powerful. Once aroused it was
sure to find ways by which some part of the benefits to
accrue to mankind from this grand discovery should
not be monopolized by a single nation. We might even
say that all the nations of Europe instinctively felt this
to be their opportunity,—the opportunity of the human
race.
</p>

<p>
France had the ships, and France had the sailors.
Sir Walter Raleigh tells us—and surely he is an
unbiassed witness—that in Cæsar's time the French
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_68' name='Page_68' href='#Page_68'>68</a></span>
Bretons were the best sailors in the world. Were we
disposed to call in question their right to this title at a
later day,—the time of Columbus, Cabot, Cortereal, and
Magellan,—what can be said of their boldly setting
sail across an unknown ocean, like the Atlantic, in
vessels not larger than a modern oyster-boat?
</p>

<p>
Yet the names they left behind them in their adventurous
voyages
make it certain
that these Basque
and Breton fishermen
pushed their
way into the Gulf
of St. Lawrence
soon after Cabot
carried home to
England the news
that he had been
in seas alive with
codfish.
</p>

<div class="figleft">

<img src="images/i-079.jpg" width="220" height="250" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SHIPS OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.</p>
</div>

<p>
The knowledge
thus gained pointed
with unerring
finger to the St.
Lawrence as the
open door through which French discoverers should
pass into the spacious interior of our broad continent,
though never, in their wildest flights of fancy, could
they have conceived what lay beyond this door. So
accident rather than choice led them on through the
colder region of the north. And while the Spaniards
had missed the Mississippi, a more fortunate chance
led Frenchmen to find it by a very different, though
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_69' name='Page_69' href='#Page_69'>69</a></span>
no less certain, route. To them be the honor of the
achievement!
</p>

<p>
Just as the march of Spanish civilization is traced in
the names given by explorers of that nation, so, in
like manner, those conferred by Frenchmen shall direct
us in the lines by which they journeyed onward toward
the setting sun.
</p>

<p>
Although Jacques Cartier<a name='FA_64' id='FA_64' href='#FN_64' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> ascended the St. Lawrence
so early as 1534-35, it was not till Champlain founded
Quebec (1608), that the work of settling a French
colony in Canada began in earnest. But even here,
at Quebec, three hundred miles from the ocean, the
great river poured its undiminished floods out of the
wilderness beyond, and it bore its greatness on its
face.
</p>

<p>
Astonished to find themselves only on the threshold,
as it were, of the continent, the adventurous pioneers
caught their first glimpses of its undoubted grandeur.
That they were dazzled by it, is something we may
easily conceive.
</p>

<p>
Whence came this silent river, this daily riddle for
men to guess, and whither would it lead them? In what
far country would its tiny tributary rills be found? Did
they lie hid among the feet of far-off mountains, over-peering
all the land like hoary giants, or gush forth
from the bosom of some vast plain? Was it indeed the
road to India?<a name='FA_65' id='FA_65' href='#FN_65' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a>
</p>

<p>
To such questions as these the future must make
answer. All believed it would lead to India. But
Champlain and those who, like him, looked at things
broadly and deeply, were convinced that whoever
should hold that river throughout its course would be
masters of the continent it undoubtedly drained. And
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' name='Page_70' href='#Page_70'>70</a></span>
as Frenchmen ever loyal to their king and country, whose
glory they would see increased, they purposed making
here, in the wilderness, a <span class="smcap">New France</span> which some
day, perhaps, should rival, if not eclipse, the old.
</p>

<p>
To this work the French brought one qualification
peculiarly their own. It was this. Of the three nations
who have contended
for control in our
country, none have
so readily adapted
themselves to the
original people as the
French have. None
have so thoroughly
respected their feelings
and prejudices.
And none have so
easily won their confidence,
or so fully
commanded their
services.
</p>

<img src="images/i-081.jpg" width="220" height="304" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A WOOD RANGER.</p>
</div>

<p>
Moreover, the
French being rather
traders than colonists
in the true
sense, because in
Canada the fur trade<a name='FA_66' id='FA_66' href='#FN_66' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> was chiefly looked to, and colonization
was thought unfavorable to it, exploration
became the profession, we might say, of many who
trained themselves for it by living among the Indians,
studying their language, their habits, learning how to
use the paddle, making long canoe voyages, and so
inuring their bodies to the toil and hardship of savage
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_71' name='Page_71' href='#Page_71'>71</a></span>
life. While the English remained in their villages, the
French wandered everywhere.
</p>

<p>
If we add to this that the French are a nation of
explorers, in whom discovery speedily develops into
a passion, we shall get at the true animating spirit
which carried them so far into the interior, whether as
simple traders, soldiers, or missionaries.
</p>

<p>
The world could ill spare one of its pioneers. They
are heralds of civilization following the guiding star of
its destiny.

From Quebec Champlain pushed on up the river to
the island of Montreal, where he established a trading-post.
Hither came the Hurons of the lake to barter
their furs for French goods. They came by way of
Lake Nipissing and the Ottawa. These Indians told
the French all about their country, and the way to it.
One of them showed Champlain an ingot of copper,
and described the way his people refined it from the
native ore. Interpreters began to study the Indian
dialects, and eager traders to push out farther and
farther into the wilderness for the sake of larger gains.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_72' name='Page_72' href='#Page_72'>72</a></span>
</p>

<p>
But the route to the west was not without perils
which the French found it hard to overcome. Two
great rival families of savages were divided from each
other by the St. Lawrence and the Lakes. Those living
north of the river may be included in the general name
of Hurons;<a name='FA_67' id='FA_67' href='#FN_67' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> those on the south were called Iroquois.<a name='FA_68' id='FA_68' href='#FN_68' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a>
The two waged perpetual war with each other, drawing
to them kindred
or tributary tribes.
In an evil hour
Champlain had
taken part with the
Hurons, so identifying
the French,
in the minds of
the Iroquois, with
their worst enemies.

<p>
If to natural obstacles
be added
the enmity of a
most valiant people,
whose country
stretched along the whole southern shore of Lake Ontario,
who controlled the portage round the Falls of
Niagara, and were undisputed masters of the lake itself,
we shall go forward with some idea of the impediments
to peaceful exploration and of the consummate
folly which had put this stumbling-block in the way
of it.
</p>

<p>
We know that before 1612 Champlain had informed
himself quite thoroughly about Lake Ontario, because
we find the lake outlined on his map of that year. For
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_73' name='Page_73' href='#Page_73'>73</a></span>
a like reason we judge him to have known of the Niagara
River and Falls.<a name='FA_69' id='FA_69' href='#FN_69' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> But that way the Iroquois lay.
</p>

<p>
This state of things forced exploration into a quite
different
channel.
The French now had
to take the roundabout
and difficult way
through the country
of the friendly Hurons,
their allies, or
in other words to
reach Lake Huron
by making a canoe
voyage up the Ottawa,
across Lake Nipissing,
and thence
down French River
to the lake, instead of going through the open waters of
Lakes Ontario and Erie.
</p>

<p class="caption">A PORTAGE.</p>
</div>

<p>
In 1615 Champlain brought some Franciscan missionaries
to Quebec, one of whom made his way up the
Ottawa to Lake Huron a little before him. In 1626
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_74' name='Page_74' href='#Page_74'>74</a></span>
came the Jesuit Fathers,<a name='FA_70' id='FA_70' href='#FN_70' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> who brought the zeal of their
order to the cause of evangelizing the Indians. Then
Richelieu,<a name='FA_71' id='FA_71' href='#FN_71' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> who held the reins of the monarchy in his
hands, founded his famous Company of New France,
to whom the King not only granted full powers of
government, but also a monopoly of the fur trade, so
turning Canada over to private hands.
</p>

<p>
An unprosperous beginning, however, awaited the
new order of things. Civil war had broken out in
France. Richelieu was beleaguering the heretics of
La Rochelle when England mingled in the fray. In
1629 the English took Quebec from the French, and did
not restore<a name='FA_72' id='FA_72' href='#FN_72' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a> it again till 1632.
</p>

<p>
At this time the conquerors had carried Champlain
to England, a prisoner of war. He returned to Quebec
in 1633, again in chief command, though soon (1635)
to die at his post, greatest among all the explorers of
his time.
</p>

<p>
With Champlain's death,<a name='FA_73' id='FA_73' href='#FN_73' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a> a new force came into the
cause of discovery and conversion, for since the coming
of the Jesuits the two were henceforth to go hand in
hand.
</p>

<p>
At the pleasure of the general of the order, its missionaries
might be sent with scrip, staff, and wallet to
the uttermost parts of the earth. Like John the Baptist
in the wilderness, we find them living on such
scant fare as nature supplied. Their beds were the
bare ground. Under a canopy of green boughs they
reared the altar of their humble missions for the worship
of the ever-living God. Thus in exile and in want,
they began their ministrations among the rude peoples
of the wilderness because God and the Blessed Virgin
had given them this pious work to do. Their food was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_75' name='Page_75' href='#Page_75'>75</a></span>
often more nourishing to the imagination than the
body, yet when compared with what they might expect
at the hands of the Iroquois, hunger counted for little,
since these barbarians of the New World burnt a missionary
alive with the same zest that Christians of the
Old did a heretic.
</p>

<p>
Men willing to undertake such duties, undergo such
hardships, live such lives, are sure to leave their impress
on any country. We shall find they did so on ours.
</p>

<p>
On their part the savages truly wished for knowledge
of the white man's God, who they were told, and believed,
was able to raise them up out of their lowly
condition and make them rich and powerful like the
whites. So much, at least, of the Jesuits' teachings
they could comprehend.
</p>

<p>
No long time elapsed before these Jesuits made their
way to the Hurons of the lake, and here (1634) they
established their first missions.
</p>

<p>
Some say that in this same year a French trader,
named Jean Nicolet,<a name='FA_74' id='FA_74' href='#FN_74' class='fnanchor'>[8]</a> made his way as far west as the
Green Bay of Lake Michigan. There is hopeless confusion
about the date, but none as to the fact of his
being the first white man to set foot in what is now the
State of Wisconsin.
</p>

<p>
When Nicolet got back to Quebec, he told the missionaries
there that he had been on a river which would
have taken him to the sea, had he kept on as he was
going but three days longer. Hearing this story, the
fathers believed themselves on the eve of no less a
discovery than the long-sought outlet to India.
</p>

<p>
Although the Spaniards said little about the discoveries
they were making on that side, they could not
prevent some knowledge of what they were doing in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_76' name='Page_76' href='#Page_76'>76</a></span>
New Mexico and on the Pacific from leaking out
through the Jesuits who were themselves concerned in
all these discoveries, and so were better informed than
others in regard to their progress.
</p>

<p>
But from the year 1640, when the missionaries so
certainly thought the key to the South Sea was in
their hands, on to 1650, or one whole decade, the
Iroquois gave the French and their allies other work to
do at home. Hardly could the French consider themselves
safe in their fort at Montreal, much less venture
abroad upon new schemes
of discovery. In vain the
missionaries cried out upon
the Iroquois as the great
scourge of Christianity. In
vain the elements were
invoked to destroy them.
The heathen were at the
doors of their monasteries,
the Dutch<a name='FA_75' id='FA_75' href='#FN_75' class='fnanchor'>[9]</a> were behind
the Iroquois, urging them on, and the future of New
France looked gloomy indeed.

<p class="caption">TOTEM OF THE FOXES.</p>
</div>

<p>
Finally (1650) the Iroquois carried the war into the
heart of the Huron country itself. The Hurons fought
well, but were soon overpowered and driven from their
villages into perpetual exile. Some fled to the east,
some to the west, thereby becoming so thoroughly dispersed
as never more to be a united nation.
</p>

<p>
With brief periods of cessation from active warfare,
which were rather truces than peace, war raged until
1661, and as the Iroquois now commanded all the
routes to the west, the French were effectually shut
out from the Great Lakes for the time being.

</div>

<p>
A brighter day dawned at last. In 1660 some Lake
Superior Indians arrived at Quebec in their canoes.
When they were ready to go back, they offered to take
a missionary home to live with them. It was a terrible
journey, but the offer could not be neglected. Accordingly
one was sent back in their company, but died in
no long time after reaching their country, of misery
and want. The Indians then asked for another missionary.
The next to go was Father Allouez,<a name='FA_76' id='FA_76' href='#FN_76' class='fnanchor'>[10]</a> who set
out in the summer of 1665 in company with some
returning savages. Nothing was heard of him for nearly
two years. He had about been given up for lost when
he appeared at Quebec bringing strange tidings indeed.
On the southern shore of Lake Superior, in the forest,
among savage hordes, he had set up a mission. He had
been much among the neighbor tribes, and had seen
and talked with the dreaded Sioux, who proudly told
him their country reached to the end of the world.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_78' name='Page_78' href='#Page_78'>78</a></span>
They also told him of a great river, which he supposed
must "fall into the sea by Virginia." The father wrote
down the name as the Sioux pronounced it,—Messipi.<a name='FA_77' id='FA_77' href='#FN_77' class='fnanchor'>[11]</a>
</p>

<p>
Following in the footsteps of Allouez (1668), Fathers
Dablon<a name='FA_78' id='FA_78' href='#FN_78' class='fnanchor'>[12]</a> and Marquette<a name='FA_79' id='FA_79' href='#FN_79' class='fnanchor'>[13]</a> were sent to the mission at
the foot of Lake Superior.
Afterward Dablon founded
that at Sault St. Marie.
<a name="Cross" id="Cross"></a>With Dablon, Allouez
(1670) made a journey
from Green Bay up Fox River to Winnebago Lake,
which they crossed. Going still farther on, they reached
the head waters of the Wisconsin, which was then
found to be a tributary of the Mississippi.
</p>

<p class="caption">FOX RIVER.</p>
</div>

<p>
Thus, in the course of a few years, the Jesuits had
planted missions at La Pointe, on Lake Superior, at
Sault St. Marie, its outlet, at the Straits of Michilimackinac,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_79' name='Page_79' href='#Page_79'>79</a></span>
and Green Bay. All were first fishing-places,
next missions, and then outposts of civilization
in the western world.
</p>

<p>
In the spring of 1671, with much ceremony, the
French took formal possession of Sault St. Marie, the
lakes Huron and Superior, and all the country as far
as the western sea. In token of sovereignty a cross of
wood was reared with the arms of France fixed upon
it. Amid volleys of musketry, and shouts of "God
save the king!" France thus proclaimed herself mistress
of the Great West.

<h4>
THE SITUATION IN A.D. 1672.
</h4>

<p>
Since the day of Champlain's death New France had
been wofully misgoverned. Men who, like him, would
be willing to give their best efforts and best years to
building up the colony, in singleness of purpose, were
not forthcoming. Champlain left no successor. Speaking
generally, the post of governor was calculated at
what it would be worth to the holder. Sometimes
it was sold outright, sometimes given in payment of
services, or again to some needy favorite as a means
to repair his ruined fortunes. Hence most governors
looked upon Canada as a place to get rich in, just as
the better sort of merchants looked to making fortunes,
and then going home to France as quickly as possible
to enjoy them. Where everybody thought about the
country only as a place of temporary sojourn and nobody
as a home, it is evident there could be no feeling
of permanence.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the short-sighted policy of continually
drawing upon the natural resources of Canada, without
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_81' name='Page_81' href='#Page_81'>81</a></span>
making the loss good, may be compared with stripping
mountains of their forests. Under this policy the
colony was like a man who is slowly bleeding to death.
</p>

<p>
But it was now the age of Louis XIV., who, if sometimes
a hard master, possessed the rare gift of bringing
round him men of superior abilities.
</p>

<p>
Once more let us glance at the two leading monarchies
of Europe, and see if their relative attitude, one
to the other, has been in any wise altered since Pavia.
</p>

<p>
Under Charles V., Spain menaced Europe with universal
dominion; under Philip II. and Philip III., she
had lost the Low Countries; under Philip IV., Portugal;
under Charles II., Burgundy and Flanders. History
offers few examples of such rapid decline.
</p>

<p>
The characters of these sovereigns may be summed
up as follows: Charles V. was a great general and great
king. Philip II. was a king only. Philip III. and
Philip IV. were not even kings. Charles II. could
hardly be called a man. This dotard, at thirty-nine,
passed his time in making and destroying his will.
Choosing rather to ally his house with France than
Germany, Charles made a French prince his heir. It
was to this prince that Louis XIV., in embracing him,
made use of the memorable words, "There are no
longer any Pyrenees."
</p>

<p>
It was then, as we have said, the age of Louis XIV.
and of French supremacy in continental affairs.
</p>

<p>
In our continent Spain was already playing a secondary
part. A more vigorous hand had seized the
standard of discovery, and was now bearing it onward
to victory.
</p>

<p>
It had gone all the way from the humble Jesuit mission
at the foot of Lake Superior to France, that the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_82' name='Page_82' href='#Page_82'>82</a></span>
greatest river of America was as good as found,—the
greatest, because all admitted that only its head streams
could have been touched, while it was seen that its
course must of necessity lie on one or the other side
of the mountains of New Mexico,—toward the Gulf of
Mexico or the Vermilion
Sea. But
on which side they
could not tell.
</p>

<p>
Of course there
were two opinions.
Some favored one,
some the other, but
either belief announced
the river
of the continent.
Whoever should
first plant themselves
at its mouth,
would inevitably
control its whole
course. And so
the idea took root
in the minds of the
statesmen and geographers of the time, who set about
trying to map out the destiny of the future empire.
</p>

<p class="caption">LOUIS XIV.</p>
</div>

<p>
The shrewdest among the French explorers did not
believe that the Mississippi and Colorado could be the
same, or that the great river flowed into the South Sea.
Father Allouez, as we have seen, thought otherwise.
In any case an incentive had been found for more earnest
effort, with more definite aims. There began to
be, in America, a really national question.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_83' name='Page_83' href='#Page_83'>83</a></span>
</p>

<p>
So it was that step by step that great mysterious
river which had so long flowed through men's brains,
grew at last into definiteness, though still waiting for
the veil of centuries to be lifted.
</p>

<p>
So far America had been the orange to be squeezed
by whoever should possess it. Louis, like the rest, no
doubt looked more to the revenue he hoped to get
from New France, than to the mere glory of extending
his dominions in that quarter, though he was also ambitious
of doing this. Yet for either purpose he must
have suitable agents, while his political aims in Europe
would be furthered by crippling the English and
Spanish colonies in America. The English were to be
hemmed in on the seaboard, while the Spaniards would
find themselves checked from advancing beyond the
limits they already occupied.
</p>

<p>
When the royal arms of France were raised at Sault
St. Marie, New England was pushing out toward the
east, not the west. No English could be found west of
the Hudson. No word of English had been heard
beyond Lake Ontario. There was not yet a Pennsylvania.
Virginia lay east of the Blue Ridge; the Carolinas
were but recently settled; Florida was hardly
more than a Spanish military post.
</p>

<p>
In all times large views demand large men for their
execution. In looking about him for a governor who
ought to be more of a soldier than politician, less a
courtier than a man of action, though something of
both, the king's eye fell upon Count Frontenac, whose
rule somewhat resembled that of his august master, in
the attempted concentration of all power in himself.
</p>

<p>
In 1672 Colbert, the prime minister, wrote to the
intendant of Canada that his majesty wished him to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_84' name='Page_84' href='#Page_84'>84</a></span>
give his attention to the discovery of the South Sea.
The wish being the same as a command, the intendant
sought for a fitting agent to carry it into effect.
</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h4>
COUNT FRONTENAC.
</h4>

<p>
Louis de Buade, Compte de Frontenac, showed
little loss of physical or mental vigor outwardly, though
at seventy incessant wear and tear had begun to tell on
a constitution and will of iron. His eye had not lost
its fire, nor his step its elasticity, but a deep crease
between the brows gave a look of care to his face, and
bespoke the power and habit of concentrated thought.
His complexion was florid, his moustache, imperial, and
eyebrows, white as snow. Notwithstanding a certain
cast of sensuality there, the face, if not noble, had that
decided distinction about it which impressed the beholder
with the idea that he was in the presence of no
ordinary man. Men called him the savior of Canada,
for he had been sent at a most critical moment to
retrieve, if possible, the blunders, the incapacity of his
predecessor, Denonville. Crafty, supple, acute, he was
the very man to comprehend Indian diplomacy, to penetrate
or baffle Indian duplicity, or by a politic act to
disarm the hostility of these wily adversaries. At the
same time, he not only knew when and where to strike
the most deadly blows, but how to draw from success
in war the most important, the most fruitful results.
The Iroquois, who waged incessant and destructive
warfare against Canada, called him the great Onontio.
He had not disdained to join an Indian war-dance, in
which he was the first to strike the war-post with his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_85' name='Page_85' href='#Page_85'>85</a></span>
hatchet. He harangued his savage allies in their own
sententious and highly imaginative rhetoric, imitated
their own methods of war, and even their atrocities in
roasting prisoners alive,—to the end, perhaps, that the
Indians might admire in him the qualities which they
most valued in themselves.

"<i>Peace hath her victories no less renowned than war.</i>"
</p>

<p>
In Louis Joliet,<a name='FA_80' id='FA_80' href='#FN_80' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> Talon, the intendant,<a name='FA_81' id='FA_81' href='#FN_81' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> found the
man he wanted. Joliet promised to see the mouth of
the Mississippi before he came back to give an account
of himself, and being already a veteran explorer, no less
was expected of him than that he would keep his word.
</p>

<p>
We remember that exploration and conversion were
now always to go hand in hand. One of the Jesuit missionaries
at the Lakes was therefore named by his superior
to go along with Joliet. This was Father James
Marquette. Father Marquette was then in charge of
the mission at Michilimackinac, where Joliet found him
impatiently expecting his coming, for ever since Marquette
had heard the Indians talk about the great river,
the wish to make a pilgrimage to it had lain next his
heart. He prayed the Virgin to obtain for him this boon,
and his prayer had been granted at last. Marquette
had also heard of the Missouri, and the natives who
dwelt in prodigious numbers along its banks. All these
things he was anxious to see with his own eyes in order
to know how far the truth would agree with what had
been told him. He was impatient to carry the gospel
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_86' name='Page_86' href='#Page_86'>86</a></span>
among all these lost tribes, to whom he felt himself
called by special appointment of Heaven.
</p>

<p>
The explorers set out from Mackinac<a name='FA_82' id='FA_82' href='#FN_82' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> in May, 1673,
in two canoes. They were seven men in all. Coasting
Lake Michigan<a name='FA_83' id='FA_83' href='#FN_83' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> till they
came to Green Bay,
they entered Fox River,
crossed Lake Winnebago,
and on the 7th of June
reached the Mascoutin
Village, where to Marquette's
great joy a cross<a name='FA_84' id='FA_84' href='#FN_84' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a>
was standing unharmed
among the wigwams to
signify that Christians
had already been there.
</p>

<p>
They had now reached
the farthest limit of previous
exploration. So far
as known no traveller had
gone beyond this spot.
</p>

<p class="caption">MARQUETTE'S MAP.</p>
</div>

<p>
At this place the
explorers took Indian
guides. Setting out again
on the 10th, they forced
the canoes slowly along
through shallow waters,
choked with wild rice, which grew so tall about them
as almost to meet above their heads, till they could
go no farther. Then lifting the canoes from the water,
the explorers bore them on their shoulders across
the prairie to the Wisconsin, upon which they again
launched them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_87' name='Page_87' href='#Page_87'>87</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"They glided calmly down the tranquil stream, by
islands choked with trees and matted with entangling
grape-vines, by forests, groves and prairies, the parks
and pleasure-grounds of a prodigal Nature; by thickets
and marshes and broad bare sandbars; under the shadowing
trees, between whose tops looked down from
afar the bold brow of some woody bluff. At night the
bivouac—the canoes
inverted on the bank,
the flickering fire, the
meal of bison flesh or
venison, the evening
pipes, and slumber beneath
the stars; and
when in the morning
they embarked again,
the mist hung on the
river like a bridal veil,
then melted before the
sun, till the glassy
water and the languid
woods basked breathless
in the sultry
glare."

</div>

<p>
On the 17th of June,
Marquette and Joliet
reached the site of Prairie du Chien. Here the Wisconsin
was swallowed up in the broad current of a
mightier stream whose dark waters swept by without
pause, like something conscious of its power. No sooner
had they looked than the eager explorers knew it for
the object of their hopes and prayers. A few vigorous
strokes of the paddles, and they were floating on its
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_88' name='Page_88' href='#Page_88'>88</a></span>
majestic tide lost in wonder and praise, for the half had
not been told them. There could be no mistake. The
long-sought Mississippi had been found again.
</p>

<p>
With cautious strokes and watchful eyes the canoes
were steered southward. Sometimes sailing in the dark
shadows of overhanging forests where danger might
lurk unseen, again gliding on through sunny prairies,
unfolding vistas of quiet beauty to the view, the delighted
explorers kept on their venturous course. It
was a voyage which threw around them the charm
of an exceeding loveliness.
</p>

<p>
Now and then the party would land to cook a hasty
meal, but not knowing what sort of people they might
meet with, they dared not sleep on shore. So at nightfall
the canoes were anchored off in the stream. For a
whole week they floated on in a primeval solitude. No
sign of the hand of man was to be seen about them.
No human voice was raised in welcome or in warning.
All was silent as at the creation. Herds of bison, grazing
along the banks, raised their shaggy heads to gaze
in wonder at the passing travellers, but in all this time
nothing in human form appeared to molest them.
</p>

<p>
One day the explorers saw footprints upon the shore.
Consulting together, they resolved to follow them.
Leaving the canoes in charge of their men, Joliet and
Marquette set out. The path led to a village whose
inhabitants sallied forth at the strange white men's
halloo, amazed to see them there. The chief men
offered the peace-pipe. Marquette asked them what
people they were.
</p>

<p>
"We are the Illinois," was the ready reply. Then
the two Frenchmen knew they were among friends<a name='FA_85' id='FA_85' href='#FN_85' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a>
who would tell them what they wanted to know about
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_89' name='Page_89' href='#Page_89'>89</a></span>
the river below—what people they were likely to fall
in with, and whether friendly or not. The Illinois
feasted the strangers, and spread buffalo-robes for them
to sleep on, but urged them not to think of descending
the river farther on account of the demon which
guarded the passage.
</p>

<p>
Going back to their comrades, with the whole village
for an escort, the explorers pushed off again on their
voyage. First they passed the Illinois,
with its remarkable rocks. Next the
Missouri,<a name='FA_86' id='FA_86' href='#FN_86' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a> child of the mountains,
poured its turbid flood into the clear
waters of the Mississippi with such
impetuous force as to cut its way
through to the opposite bank, so giving
its own dull hue to the whole
stream.
</p>

<p class="caption">ILLINOIS.</p>
</div>

<p>
Getting clear of all dangers, the
adventurous voyagers next passed the
mouth of the Ohio, or Beautiful River.
Day after day they floated on between
forests of cypress, only once meeting
with Indians by the way, till they had
descended as far as the mouth of the Arkansas, when
suddenly a fleet of war canoes was seen putting off from
the shore to cut them off. In vain Marquette waved the
calumet,<a name='FA_87' id='FA_87' href='#FN_87' class='fnanchor'>[8]</a> which the Illinois had given him to be his safeguard,
and which among savages is the symbol of peace.
The young warriors fitted their arrows and bent their
bows. In another moment the explorers would have
been riddled with arrows, but for the timely arrival of
the elders who called out to the young men to stay
their hands. With these the French now held a parley,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_90' name='Page_90' href='#Page_90'>90</a></span>
and having made known their pacific intentions, were
suffered to land and were kindly treated.
</p>

<p>
With the help of one among them who understood
a little of the Illinois tongue, Marquette was able to
make his purpose to reach the sea understood. He
now learned that this was not the principal town of the
Arkansas nation. That was eight or ten leagues farther
down the river. So the next day the Frenchmen
went on to the greater town,<a name='FA_88' id='FA_88' href='#FN_88' class='fnanchor'>[9]</a> where they hoped to learn
all they wished to know.
</p>

<p>
Strangely enough, the explorers had now reached the
very point made memorable by the coming of De Soto
a century and a half earlier. And as if his fate had
cast a spell over the spot where they stood following
the course of the great river with their eyes till it was
lost in the distance, neither Joliet nor Marquette was
destined to pass beyond it.
</p>

<p class="caption">WAR CANOE, FROM LA HONTAN.</p>
</div>

<p>
Here the Indians gave the explorers a feast, while
holding a council upon the question whether they could
or could not proceed with safety. In return the whites
distributed gifts among the Indians. These Indians
had little food except corn, of which they raised three
crops each year. In addition to this, they gave their
visitors dog's flesh to eat, as a mark of honorable treatment.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_91' name='Page_91' href='#Page_91'>91</a></span>
Although they had knives and hatchets of
European make, and could mould rude earthenware
pots and jars to cook their food in, these people were
of lower condition than those who lived higher up the
river, although from symmetry of form they were
known as the "handsome men." The men went entirely
nude; the women wore skins about their loins.
</p>

<p>
They told Marquette that the people lower down
would never let him pass through their country; that
they were a
people who had
fire-arms and
knew how to
use them. This
made them so
formidable to their neighbors, that these Arkansas dared
not hunt the buffalo in that country, though the plains
there were alive with them.

<p class="caption">THE CALUMET.</p>
</div>

<p>
Such ill reports touching the obstacles in the way of
further progress decided the explorers to turn back,
although the Indians said the sea was only ten journeys
distant. They were too few to fight. Their capture
would most surely frustrate the whole purpose of the
expedition. All felt that this chance should not be
risked. They had at least gone far enough to settle the
vexed question about the outlet to the sea. All indications
pointed to the Gulf of Mexico.
</p>

<p>
It is evident that the explorers took counsel of their
own wishes, perhaps of their own fears, in making their
decision to go back. Be that as it may, Joliet had not
kept his promise to Talon.
</p>

<p>
On the 17th of July the explorers began their long
journey homeward. They were weeks making their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_92' name='Page_92' href='#Page_92'>92</a></span>
way back to the Illinois, into which they turned their
canoes, knowing it would shorten the journey. Ascending
this river to the Indian town of Kaskaskia, the
party procured guides who conducted them to Lake
Michigan.

<h4>
THE MAN LA SALLE.
</h4>

<p class="center">
"<i>Eagles fly above, but sheep flock together.</i>"—<i>Spanish.</i>
</p>

<p>
The Mississippi had now been struck at two points.
Its course had been explored for six hundred miles,
glimpses of its greatness had been caught, its mysteries
partly solved. A man of greater mark now put his
hand to the completion of what Marquette and Joliet
had left unfinished.
</p>

<p>
Robert Cavelier de la Salle<a name='FA_89' id='FA_89' href='#FN_89' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> was no simple explorer,
having some little education, like Joliet, or pious missionary,
whose sole object was to make proselytes, like
Marquette.
</p>

<p>
La Salle was a man of far different mould. In him
the man of brains, of ideas, of resources, of unbending
will, were all joined in one. He was a serious man,—a
man of heroic patience, whose highest qualities shone
forth brightest in moments of supreme trial. Disaster,
calumny, treachery, disease, assailed by turns, but could
never crush his indomitable spirit. Whether he stood
alone amid the wreck of his projects, or was confronted
by unforeseen perils, his fortitude never forsook him.
Although rather stern than indulgent toward his men,
there was that in him which commanded respect and
obedience; more, La Salle did not desire. He was the
master-spirit of his own enterprises—the originator and
executor of them—not the simple agent of other men's
schemes. From a study of the man, in the light of
what he aimed to do and what he actually achieved,
we should say that, "Where there's a will there's a
way," was the inspiration of La Salle's efforts, and
unique maxim of his career.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_94' name='Page_94' href='#Page_94'>94</a></span>
</p>

<p class="caption">CAVELIER DE LA SALLE.</p>
</div>

<p>
But La Salle had his drawbacks also. Naturally
thoughtful and reserved he lived too much apart, in
himself, to be a good companion in the wandering
republic of which he was the head, though his followers
learned to look up to him if they could not love him.
He could not unbosom himself to his inferiors, nor
could they understand that mixture of pride and reserve
which wrapped him
about like a garment.
What they took for
austerity of manner
was the absorption of
the man in himself.
Those who knew him
best would have followed
him to the end
of the world, but La
Salle was so constituted
that few could
know him. Of all this
La Salle, himself, was
unconscious. His responsibilities
were too
great, his cares too
many, for indulgence in trivial things. With minds
like Louis XIV., Colbert or Frontenac, the case was
different. La Salle impressed them as no ordinary man
could. So when the possibility of getting control of
our continent by stretching a chain of French posts
from Quebec to the St. Lawrence unfolded itself to his
mind, in its grandeur, the King at once saw in La Salle
the fittest man for the work. And La Salle knew no
such word as fail.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_96' name='Page_96' href='#Page_96'>96</a></span>
</p>
</div>

<p>
La Salle was one of those who in the beginning
believed the Mississippi flowed into the Vermilion Sea.
If we may put faith in appearances, his original idea
was not so much to descend the great river to its mouth,
as to make his way across the continent to the great
South Sea, and so to reach China and Japan. And the
name of La Chine,<a name='FA_90' id='FA_90' href='#FN_90' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> which La Salle gave his own residence,
at Montreal, really seems an indication of what
was then uppermost in his mind.
</p>

<p>
This is instructive as showing how slowly geographical
knowledge of the westward half of the continent
unfolded itself.
</p>

<p>
As we have said, Cavelier de la Salle was a man of
one idea, practical in some things, visionary in others,
but in pursuit of a purpose as steadfast as fate.
</p>

<p>
In 1666, at twenty-three, he found himself in Canada.
He took up his residence at the upper end of the island
of Montreal, where the St. Lawrence is broken up into
rapids which to this day bear the name of La Salle's
residence, La Chine.
</p>

<p>
Here La Salle quietly spent three years, hearing the
while from the Indians who came to La Chine, all sorts
of strange stories about the vast region toward the
setting sun, and the people who lived in it.
</p>

<p>
We have seen the missions already firmly established
on the Great Lakes. Joliet and Marquette had reached
the Mississippi by one route and returned by another
and different one, leading them through the heart of
the great Illinois nation, to whom Marquette believed
himself specially called. His labors among this people
had left an impression highly favorable to those who
might come after him.
</p>

<p>
It was from the Iroquois, who came to visit him at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_97' name='Page_97' href='#Page_97'>97</a></span>
La Chine, that La Salle first heard of the Ohio. The
passion for discovery seems to have found swift and
intense development in him. He was young, ambitious
and eager for adventure. La Salle was only twenty-six
when he resolved to go in search of the Ohio.
</p>

<p>
Immediately he sold La Chine to procure an outfit.
In the summer of 1669 he set out for the Iroquois country
where we lose sight of him altogether. Yet, while
no itinerary of his journey remains extant, his claim to
have discovered the Ohio is conceded by his rival,
Joliet.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Frontenac, that man of action, was not
idle. He was bent on opening the direct road to the
western lakes, peaceably if he could, forcibly if he
must, but at any rate to open it. To this end he now
showed the Iroquois that he was not afraid of them by
building a fort at Kingston,<a name='FA_91' id='FA_91' href='#FN_91' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> which was called, in his
honor, Fort Frontenac. This post gave the command
of Lake Ontario to the French. It was at once a check
and a menace to the Iroquois, who saw the mastery of
the lakes slipping away from them but could not prevent
it. Through his favor with Frontenac, La Salle
secured from the king a grant of Fort Frontenac, which,
in his hands, became not only an important trading-post,
but the base of future contemplated discoveries.
Here La Salle brooded over the projects which were to
make him famous not for a day, but for all time.
</p>

<p>
For ten years more La Salle is found repairing his
fortunes, maturing his plans, acquiring information, or
studying Indian dialects. The Gulf of Mexico was to
be reached, and a French port and colony established
there into which all the trade of the river should flow.
Thus the Mississippi, in French hands, was to be a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_98' name='Page_98' href='#Page_98'>98</a></span>
wedge dividing the Spaniards in Florida from the Spaniards
in New Mexico. Possessed of the two great
waterways of the continent—the St. Lawrence and
Mississippi—France was to take the first place in
America. When all was ready La Salle laid his plans
before the King.
</p>

<p>
In his memorial La Salle forcibly contrasts the barren
soil, dense forests and harsh climate of Canada, with
the fertile soil, sunny prairies and genial climate of the
West. He describes it as being a country possessed of
every thing requisite for planting flourishing colonies;
and as one thoroughly familiar with it. Its native
products, its abundance of fish and game, its pleasant
streams, are all dwelt upon without the exaggeration
with which explorers usually embellish their reports.
In La Salle's view the facts were all-sufficient for his
purpose.
</p>

<p>
In thus seeking the enlargement of French empire at
the expense of Spain, La Salle had found a congenial
field for his talents—a purpose which lifts him above
the rank of a mere explorer or trader. It is true he
expected to find riches and honor for himself, yet these
were things which, of necessity, hinged upon the success
of the scheme as a whole, not of a part.
</p>

<p>
Impressed by La Salle's representations, Louis granted
him a patent for those regions he proposed to discover,
with power to build forts and govern therein for the
term of five years. La Salle was to do all this at his
own cost, looking to his monopoly of trade to reimburse
himself. So he set about borrowing money right and
left. Never generous, the King limited himself to giving
La Salle the opportunity he asked for.

stood in September, 1678.

<h4>
LA SALLE, PRINCE OF EXPLORERS.
</h4>

<p>
La Salle's plans included the following details. A
vessel had been built at Frontenac for the navigation
of Lake Ontario, so doing away with the tedious canoe
voyages of the past. This brought the western missions
one step nearer Montreal. Next, the Niagara
River was to be seized upon and held, as Frontenac had
been, by building a fort at its mouth. The next step
would be the construction of a vessel, above the falls,
to navigate the western lakes. With this done the real
point of departure for the Mississippi would be removed
to Lake Michigan, and the delay and fatigue of previous
expeditions saved to the present one. Such were the
essential features of La Salle's plan.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly La Salle set about building the fort at
Niagara<a name='FA_92' id='FA_92' href='#FN_92' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> and the vessel above the falls, during the
winter of 1679. In a word, he was perfecting his communications
as he went along.
</p>

<p>
In August La Salle embarked on board his new
vessel and hoisted sail. It was the first which had ever
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_100' name='Page_100' href='#Page_100'>100</a></span>
ploughed the waters of Lake Erie. In due season he
reached Michilimackinac, whence, after some stay, he
again sailed for Green Bay. Here La Salle landed his
people and goods. The Griffin was sent back to
Niagara, for the supplies La Salle wanted, with order
to return without delay to the rendezvous. With fourteen
men La Salle then started in canoes on his journey
to the Mississippi.
</p>

<p>
Various adventures signalled the progress of the explorers
along the shores of Lake Michigan, as far as the
mouth of the St. Joseph, which had been chosen for
the final point of departure. The autumn season was
well advanced. Already the north wind blew keen and
cold across the lake. The canoes were tossed about
on a stormy sea, which broke with violence against
the inhospitable coast, threatening shipwreck if they
approached it. Often the canoes would be swamped in
the surf when the rising sea made it dangerous to keep
the lake. Often the explorers threw themselves on the
frozen ground at night, wet to the skin and famishing
with hunger.
</p>

<p>
Reaching the St. Joseph, La Salle set his men to
work building a fort, while he anxiously waited the
coming of Tonty, who had been ordered to join him at
this place. At last Tonty came. Winter had now set
in. In the first days of December the united party
paddled up the St. Joseph, crossed over the portage to
the Kankakee, descended it to the Illinois, reaching at
length the great Illinois town,<a name='FA_93' id='FA_93' href='#FN_93' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> numbering, by actual
count, four hundred and sixty lodges.
</p>

<p>
To their great disappointment the town was deserted,
all the Illinois having gone to hunt the buffalo, as their
custom was at this season of the year. It was a heavy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_101' name='Page_101' href='#Page_101'>101</a></span>
blow to La Salle, who had expected to get guides and
a supply of food here, as well as to recruit his men.
The explorers however obtained a supply by opening
the <i>caches</i><a name='FA_94' id='FA_94' href='#FN_94' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> in which the Illinois kept their winter store.
</p>

<p>
Somewhere below Peoria Lake, La Salle fell in with
the Illinois, who told him all the fables they could
invent in order to prevent his going on, for it seems
they had some inkling his doing so would be prejudicial
to them in the future.
</p>

<p>
The Mississippi, they said, was beset by men of fierce
aspect who would kill them all, its waters infested with
serpents, alligators and like monsters lying in wait to
devour them, while the river itself finally plunged into
a raging whirlpool in which they and their canoes
would be swallowed up.
</p>

<p>
Although La Salle treated these silly tales with the
contempt they deserved, they took effect upon his men,
six of whom deserted on the spot. The explorers wintered
among these Illinois in a fort which La Salle
significantly named Crèvecœur.<a name='FA_95' id='FA_95' href='#FN_95' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a>
</p>

<p>
The name tells its own story. On the lakes they had
been nearly drowned. On the march they had often
gone hungry, La Salle with the rest. Treason was with
him in his own camp, danger in that of the Illinois.
His own men had tried to poison him. And now, to
cap the climax of misfortune, no word had come of the
Griffin<a name='FA_96' id='FA_96' href='#FN_96' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a>—the Griffin on which hung all hope of successfully
continuing their search.
</p>

<p>
But nothing could shake the resolve of La Salle.
Sending Father Hennepin to explore the lower course
of the Illinois, the chief left Tonty in charge of Fort
Crèvecœur, while he himself set out for Frontenac in
order to learn what had become of the Griffin, and bring
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_102' name='Page_102' href='#Page_102'>102</a></span>
back the things he must have before it would be possible
to stir from Fort Crèvecœur again.
</p>

<p>
We need not follow him on this remarkable journey,
itself no mean exploit.
</p>

<p>
La Salle had not yet reached the Mississippi. In
August, 1680, he again left Montreal with this object.
Again he made his way to the Illinois village. This
time heaps of charred and blackened rubbish, strewed
with mangled bodies, met his eyes. During his absence
the Iroquois had wreaked their vengeance upon the
Illinois, as already they had done upon the Hurons.
</p>

<img src="images/i-113.jpg" width="400" height="142" alt="" />
<p class="caption">INDIAN WAMPUM BELT.</p>
</div>

<p>
Where was the faithful Tonty? What had become
of him? After La Salle's departure, his men rose
against Tonty, plundered the fort of what was worth
taking, demolished it, and went off in a body, leaving
Tonty to shift for himself.
</p>

<p>
But where was he? La Salle found Crèvecœur in
ruins, and the place a solitude.
</p>

<p>
In despair La Salle searched the river to its mouth,
so reaching the Mississippi at last, but without finding
the least trace of his lieutenant. On every side fate
seemed conspiring for his defeat.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_103' name='Page_103' href='#Page_103'>103</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Still undaunted, for the third time La Salle set out
in the autumn of 1681. In a wonderful manner Tonty
had made his escape from the Iroquois, and rejoined his
chief on the lakes. This time the expedition passed
through the Chicago River to the Illinois, and thence
down to the Mississippi, which was reached on the 6th
of February.
</p>

<p>
After a short stay here the little fleet of canoes
resumed the long voyage before them. On the 24th,
the explorers landed near the Third Chickasaw Bluff
to hunt. Here they built a stockade which was called
Fort Prudhomme.<a name='FA_97' id='FA_97' href='#FN_97' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a>
</p>

<p>
Few incidents marked the passage of the explorers
through the countries of the Arkansas, Tensas<a name='FA_98' id='FA_98' href='#FN_98' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a> and
Natchez nations, till the Frenchmen reached the neighborhood
of the Quinipissas, when they were shot at
from the canebrakes along the banks, though without
receiving any hurt.
</p>

<p>
Knowing he was among a multitude of foes, La Salle
prudently refrained from returning the fire.
</p>

<p>
On the 6th of April, the explorers found the river
branching out before them in three streams. Which to
take, they knew not. That there should be no mistake
about it, La Salle took the westernmost himself, Tonty
the middle, and another the eastern branch. Presently
some one dipped up a cupful of water to drink. It
proved to be brackish to the taste. La Salle knew now
he was nearing his goal.
</p>

<p>
At last the canoes glided past the outermost point of
low, reedy land, out upon the broad bosom of the Gulf.
</p>

<p>
Landing not far above the mouth of the river, La
Salle caused the arms of France to be set up at that
place, and then and there, on the ninth day of April,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_104' name='Page_104' href='#Page_104'>104</a></span>
1682, he took formal possession of the country watered
by the Mississippi. It was in the name of Louis XIV.
that he did so, in whose honor La Salle declared the
name of this vast acquisition to be Louisiana.
</p>

<p>
Yet in no long time we find Louis writing with his
own hands words like these: "Like you,"—he is addressing
M. de La Barre,<a name='FA_99' id='FA_99' href='#FN_99' class='fnanchor'>[8]</a>—"I am persuaded that the
discovery of the Sieur de La Salle is very useless; and
it is necessary hereafter to prevent similar enterprises
which can have no other result than to debauch the
people by the hope of gain, and to diminish the revenue
from the beaver."

<div class="chapter">
<h4>
DISCOVERY OF THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI.
</h4>

<p>
It will be remembered, that, when La Salle found
himself so unfortunately stopped among the Illinois, his
active mind was promptly casting about for something
to be achieved elsewhere. This object he found in the
Upper Mississippi, which he determined should be
explored in his absence, so interlocking his own discoveries
with those of Joliet and Marquette. Two of
his people were accordingly sent to perform this duty,
with whom went Father Hennepin,<a name='FA_100' id='FA_100' href='#FN_100' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> the Franciscan missionary
before spoken of.
</p>

<p>
The party set out from Fort Crèvecœur on the last
day of February, 1680, while at the same time La Salle
was starting northward for Lake Ontario.
</p>

<p>
As historian of the expedition, Hennepin's vanity has
led him to claim the leadership for himself, while he
accuses La Salle of meaning to get rid of him,<a name='FA_101' id='FA_101' href='#FN_101' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> in the
same breath. We know, however, from La Salle that
neither is true. La Salle was much too good a judge of
character not to see through the friar after so long trial
of him, though, knowing him to be capable, he gave him
the chance of being useful. For the expedition itself,
it is certain La Salle had it much at heart. Touching
Hennepin's narrative, La Salle dryly says the friar
"spoke more according to his wishes than what he
knew," or, in the familiar phrase, was in the habit of
drawing on his imagination for his facts.
</p>

<p>
Hennepin himself seems to have been that singular
anomaly, seldom met with in real life, a brave braggart,
whose self-conceit and arrogant self-assertion stand forth
in strong contrast with the modesty and patience always
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_106' name='Page_106' href='#Page_106'>106</a></span>
shown by La Salle when he is speaking of his
own achievements. And it is further characteristic of
the two men, that while one felt he could afford to wait
for time to do him justice, the other sought the cheap
glory to be had by sounding his own praise abroad, even
when exposure was certain to follow. So that nothing
Hennepin has written can be accepted as true, without
other evidence to substantiate it. The more is the
pity! But the exaggerations of all our early chronicles
show that they were penned by men influenced by the
passions or rivalries of the time, often so distorting what
is true as to make it fit the particular end they may have
had in view. To this lamentable want of integrity may
be attributed the fact that history has so often to be
re-written.
</p>

<p>
For six weeks the explorers plied their paddles against
the current of the Mississippi unmolested. One day
when they had drawn their canoe on shore to repair it,
the Frenchmen were suddenly surrounded by a war
party of Sioux<a name='FA_102' id='FA_102' href='#FN_102' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a>—the very people of all others whom
they most wished to avoid.
</p>

<p>
In a moment the whites were made prisoners. The
scowling looks and threatening gestures of their captors
boded them no good. Hennepin proffered the
peace-pipe. It was snatched from his hand. When he
began muttering prayers aloud, the Indians angrily
signed to him to be silent, thinking he was preparing
some charm to overpower them with, but they let him
chant the same prayers, he says, thinking there could
be no sorcery or medicine in song. Presently the Sioux
began their homeward journey, thus making it clear to
the Frenchmen that their future discoveries must be
made as captives.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_107' name='Page_107' href='#Page_107'>107</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In nineteen days the party landed near the site of
St. Paul.<a name='FA_103' id='FA_103' href='#FN_103' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> From here the trail was struck leading to
the Sioux villages, which were reached after five days
of hard marching and harder usage at the hands of the
Sioux warriors.
</p>

<p>
Here the prisoners were separated, Hennepin going
to an aged chief who adopted him as his own son. So
they passed the winter among
the Sioux.
</p>

<p>
In the following summer,
when the Sioux went on their
annual buffalo hunt, they took
the three Frenchmen along
with them. This was the prisoners'
opportunity for regaining
their liberty, and they
hastened to make use of it.
La Salle had promised to send
word of himself to them at
the mouth of the Wisconsin,
and they knew he would not
fail them. Telling the Sioux
their friends were coming, loaded with gifts, the greedy
Sioux were easily induced to let Hennepin and one
other go down the river to meet them alone and unguarded.
One Frenchman remained behind with the
Sioux as a hostage for the others.
</p>

<p>
The two whites began their descent of the river,
carrying their canoe round the Falls of St. Anthony,<a name='FA_104' id='FA_104' href='#FN_104' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a>
to which Father Hennepin gave this name, till, after
many adventures, Lake Pepin<a name='FA_105' id='FA_105' href='#FN_105' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a> was reached.
</p>

<img src="images/i-118.jpg" width="150" height="206" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SIOUX CHIEF.</p>
</div>
<p>
To their consternation, the travellers were overtaken
at this point by a party of Sioux who had followed their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_108' name='Page_108' href='#Page_108'>108</a></span>
prisoners so closely, as hardly to lose sight of them,
and now pushed on ahead to the Wisconsin. Finding
neither traders<a name='FA_106' id='FA_106' href='#FN_106' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a> nor goods there, as they had been led
to expect, the Sioux paddled back again in bad humor to
the place where the whites had remained. After being
soundly rated for the cheat they had practised, the
unlucky whites were forced to turn about and go back
again as they came.
</p>

<p>
After some longer stay among the Sioux, the captives
were found by some French traders who had made their
way from Lake Superior,
through the Sioux country,
to the Mississippi. Hearing
of the three white men,
while on the way, these
traders had kept on from
village to village, till they
reached the one in which
Hennepin and his companions
were detained, and ransomed
them out of the hands
of the savages.
</p>

</div>
<p>
At the head of the rescuing party was one Du Lhut,
or Duluth, for whom the city of Duluth is named, as
Lake Pepin is also said to have been named for another
of this party. Thus, in St. Anthony's Falls, Lake
Pepin, and Duluth we have a group of names commemorating
the men of La Salle's exploring party, as
well as the exploration itself.
</p>

<p>
All the Frenchmen now returned to the Sioux villages
at Mille Lac together.
</p>

<p>
They finally made their way back to the French settlements
by the Wisconsin and Green Bay route, as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_109' name='Page_109' href='#Page_109'>109</a></span>
Marquette had done before them, and the Sioux<a name='FA_107' id='FA_107' href='#FN_107' class='fnanchor'>[8]</a> also
for many generations had travelled to the great lake.

</h4>

<p>
Thus, in 1682, La Salle had secured an empire for
France, and at last found a legitimate field for his own
ambition. His Louisiana comprised every thing between
the Alleghanies and Rio Grande, the Gulf of
Mexico and Hudson's Bay. Upon opening the maps
of the time we find the English crowded into the comparatively
narrow limits extending from the eastern
slopes of the Appalachian range to the sea, the Spaniards
occupying those between the Rio Grande and
Gulf of California, while the whole great heart of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_110' name='Page_110' href='#Page_110'>110</a></span>
continent, including portions of Carolina and Florida,
with its magnificent system of waterways, is covered
by the names New France and Louisiana.
</p>

<p>
But La Salle himself, the man of large and luminous
views, had now reached the high-water-mark of his
achievements. The wave which owed its impetus to
his active brain, expended its force with his life.
</p>

<p>
Upon his return voyage up the Mississippi the explorer
fell sick. He was taken to Fort Prudhomme,
the one built by his order on the way down, where he
lay for months a helpless invalid, chafing under the
inaction thus forced upon him. As soon as he felt
strong enough to bear the journey, La Salle proceeded
on to Michilimackinac, where he was no sooner arrived
than he set about the work of rebuilding the trading-post
on the Illinois, in room of the one his treacherous
followers had destroyed in his absence.
</p>

<p>
This was to be his half-way house to the Mississippi.
Here he trusted to gather a colony alike capable of
drawing to itself all the trade of a vast tributary region,
as of defending itself and his allies, the Illinois, against
the incursions of the Iroquois.
</p>

<p>
But La Salle's greater project for securing the results
of his discoveries, by planting a colony at the mouth of
the Mississippi, henceforth looked to reaching that point
by sea and not by land. To transport every thing overland
from Quebec to the Gulf was of course impracticable.
No one knew this better than La Salle himself,
yet he also foresaw the importance of keeping the way
to Canada open if the colony at the Gulf was to thrive.
To this end the fort on the Illinois, and that at the
Chickasaw Bluff, were but incidents.
</p>

<p>
After establishing himself strongly on the Illinois,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_111' name='Page_111' href='#Page_111'>111</a></span>
La Salle went to France in order to lay his projects
before the King.
</p>

<p>
In consequence of a rupture with Spain he found the
court well disposed to listen to his proposals. These
contemplated the building of a fort sixty leagues above
the mouth of the Mississippi, which La Salle assumed
would draw around it, as to a common centre, all the
neighbor tribes. Gifts and good usage had already disposed
these tribes favorably toward the French, while
the Spaniards had already alienated them by harsh
treatment. With their help La Salle asserted that
the conquest of New Biscay,<a name='FA_108' id='FA_108' href='#FN_108' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> with its rich silver-mines,
would be an easy matter, because there were
not more than four hundred Spaniards in all that
province.
</p>

<p>
The plan met instant favor. To enable La Salle
to carry it out, four vessels were given him instead of
the two he asked for. A naval officer by the name
of Beaujeu was assigned to command them at sea. La
Salle set himself to work with his usual energy. Soldiers,
priests and colonists, arms, munitions and stores,
were provided in sufficient number or quantity to put
the colony on its feet at once.
</p>

<p>
Long before the ships were ready to sail from Rochefort,
La Salle and Beaujeu had quarrelled. Beaujeu
overrated himself, and underrated La Salle. Often
betrayed by those he trusted most, La Salle's naturally
suspicious nature led him to distrust every one, above
all Beaujeu, who constantly ridiculed him and his
schemes to his friends. So La Salle's reserve gave
offence to Beaujeu, who grew sulky, and was at no
pains to conceal his dislike for the whole affair. Here
then at the very outset the seeds of disaster were sowed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_112' name='Page_112' href='#Page_112'>112</a></span>
It was under such unpromising conditions that the fleet
set sail in July, 1684, for the Gulf of Mexico.
</p>

<p>
Three of the vessels reached St. Domingo in two
months, with a large number of sick on board, of whom
La Salle himself was one. The fourth had been taken
at sea by Spanish buccaneers, thus depriving the colonists
of the tools and provisions with which she was
loaded.
</p>

<p>
Upon La Salle's recovery from what came near proving
a fatal illness, the fleet again put to sea, though it
was now November, and much precious time had been
lost.
</p>

<p>
Steering westward into the Gulf, they made their
landfall on New Year's Day, but when La Salle went
on shore to look about him, he could discover no sign
of the great river he was in search of. The colonists
were upon a low, flat coast, without natural landmarks
to guide them, or knowledge of the longitude of the
place they were seeking, or of the currents which the
Gulf sets in motion. No wonder, then, that La Salle
failed to recognize any part of the inhospitable coast
before him.
</p>

<p>
Finding no trace of the Mississippi, and as the failure
to do so was every day productive of disputes between
himself and Beaujeu, La Salle resolved to land where
he was, notwithstanding his belief that he had gone too
far to the westward. He was, in fact, at the time of
taking this resolution, on the coast of Texas, more than
four hundred miles from the Mississippi.
</p>

<p>
Almost at the moment of landing, La Salle's storeship,
which contained the greater part of his provisions,
grounded, and became a wreck; it is said, through the
carelessness or treachery of her master, who also was on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_113' name='Page_113' href='#Page_113'>113</a></span>
bad terms with La Salle. Indeed, from first to last La
Salle's enemies seem to have exerted themselves to ruin
him with a zeal that, if honestly employed, would easily
have insured the success of all his plans.
</p>

<p>
This disaster, taken with the fact that he knew not
where he was, would have staggered any one but La
Salle. His dispirited people were huddled together on
the sands, among the bales and boxes saved from the
wreck, out of which they made themselves a temporary
intrenchment and shelter, for like vultures who scent
their prey from afar, hostile Indians hovered about the
encampment, watching their chance to cut off any who
should stray away from its protection.
</p>

<p>
Yet misgiving for the success of an enterprise so disastrously
begun, was turned into dread when the colonists
learned that they were nowhere near their actual
destination. La Salle, indeed, tried to put heart in them
by pretending to believe otherwise, but a little time
soon dispelled this fallacy. He, however, took the best
means of quieting discontent by setting every one at
work. Beaujeu had sailed away after promising much,
but performing little else. The colonists now had
much more to fear from the Spaniards, than the Spaniards
from them. Yet for La Salle nothing remained
but to make the best of the situation until he should
have time to look it fairly in the face.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the essential thing to be done was to get
his people housed in a situation which should admit of
their living in some comfort and security, as the place
where they first landed was alike destitute of wood,
water and comfortable lodging.
</p>

<p>
He therefore chose a site on the Lavaca River,<a name='FA_109' id='FA_109' href='#FN_109' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> two
leagues above its entrance into Matagorda Bay. To
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_114' name='Page_114' href='#Page_114'>114</a></span>
this place the colonists removed themselves and their
goods, and under the energetic direction of La Salle,
whose previous training now stood him in good stead,
they set about building themselves a home in this out-of-the-way
corner of the world. As it rose from the
soil, the ever-loyal La Salle named it St. Louis,<a name='FA_110' id='FA_110' href='#FN_110' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> in
honor of his sovereign.
</p>

<p>
The summer was hot and sickly. Death was soon
busy among the colonists, those who ate wild fruits
imprudently suffering first of all. Now and then the
Indians would kill some straggling hunter. Thus, in
one or another form, death lurked about them. And
beneath these apparent dangers, in which all shared
alike, smouldered the embers of unreasoning discontent
which certain of La Salle's followers were always fanning
into a flame.
</p>

<p>
Having seen his people comfortably housed, and in
condition to defend themselves, the indefatigable La
Salle now turned his attention to the prime purpose of
his expedition, with the certainty of the needle to its
pole, for all he had so far done was merely a step in
this direction. There was no time to lose.
</p>

<p>
Although it is not clear why La Salle should determine
to march overland, rather than make search along
the shores, the character of the Gulf coast affords a
possible clew. This is described by Mr. Cable as follows:
"Across the southern end of the State,"—he is
speaking now of Louisiana,—"from Sabine Lake to
Chandeleur Bay, with a north and south width of from
ten to thirty miles, and an average of about fifteen,
stretch the Gulf marshes, the wild haunt of myriads of
birds and water-fowl, serpents and saurians, hares, raccoons
and wildcats, deep-bellowing frogs, and clouds of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_115' name='Page_115' href='#Page_115'>115</a></span>
insects, and by a few hunters whose solitary and rarely
frequented huts speck the wide green horizon at remote
intervals."
</p>

<p>
It was now October, 1685. With fifty men La Salle
set out for the river he had discovered only to lose
again. Those who staid behind, lived on buffalo-meat,<a name='FA_110b' id='FA_110b' href='#FN_110b' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a>
turtles, oysters, fish, and wild fowl which the
prairies or lagoons around them plentifully supplied in
their season.
</p>

<p>
In March, the exploring party came back unsuccessful
and in rags. They had wandered far, but had not
found the Mississippi. One crowning disaster now befell
these exiles. Up to this time they had kept one little
vessel of their fleet with them, which was to take them
to the Mississippi so soon as its exact situation should
be discovered. This vessel, in which their sole dependence
lay, was now lost.
</p>

<p>
In desperate situations, desperate measures are alone
to be availed of. La Salle's resolve was heroic. He
determined to make a last effort to reach the Mississippi
and the lakes. Indeed, there was now no hope
of obtaining relief nearer than Canada, therefore to
Canada he must go, leaving the colonists to await his
return.
</p>

<p>
For this purpose La Salle chose twenty men, with
whom he again set out from the fort on the 22d of
April, 1686. Each man carried his own pack and
weapons, and as the little band filed out upon the
prairie, the hopes of the lost colony went forth with
them in their desperate venture.
</p>

<p>
But these hopes sunk low when La Salle came back
with only eight of the twenty who had gone with him.
The explorers had penetrated as far as the country of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_116' name='Page_116' href='#Page_116'>116</a></span>
the Cenis Indians,<a name='FA_111' id='FA_111' href='#FN_111' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> when sickness and desertion had
so crippled their strength as to make further progress
hopeless for the time. They, however, procured some
horses from the Indians which were brought back to
the fort.
</p>

<p>
No other resource being open, La Salle once more
essayed the task before him. In the straits in which he
and his people were placed, his splendid qualities for
leadership shine out of the gloom like a guiding star.
The resources of the colony were nearly exhausted in
fitting out previous parties, but the scanty stores were
ransacked anew to equip those who were to be the saviors
of the rest. The horses which La Salle had brought in
were loaded with baggage and ammunition. All was
ready. A midnight mass was solemnly said. La Salle
spoke a few hopeful words to those who were to endure
a suspense perhaps even greater than his own, and then,
mastering his own feelings, he turned away to join his
followers,—the forlorn hope of the expiring colony.
</p>

<p>
On the 15th of March, 1687, the hunters who were
out killed a buffalo. The party therefore halted till
the meat could be brought into camp. Here it was
that the hatred, long nursed in secret, openly revealed
itself in murder. Misery always begets quarrels, but in
this case the sole incitement was revenge. La Salle
had the unhappy faculty of making enemies, of whom
his worst ones were then close at hand, and plotting
for his life. A quarrel about the meat hastened the
work on. Those who were faithful to La Salle became
the conspirators' first victims. Three of these, whom
La Salle had sent over to the hunters' camp, were
butchered while they slept.
</p>

<p>
La Salle himself was encamped six miles distant from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_117' name='Page_117' href='#Page_117'>117</a></span>
the place where these murders were committed. Growing
uneasy at the long absence of the men he had sent
away, he started with an Indian guide for their camp.
A friar named Douay also accompanied him. This friar
noted in La Salle's talk and manner the presentiment
of coming evil. On reaching a point which he supposed
to be near the hunters' camp, La Salle fired his musket
as a signal. One of the conspirators showed himself,
while the others lay hid in the long prairie-grass unobserved.
La Salle fell into the snare thus set for him.
While advancing toward the decoy, whose insolent
replies angered him, La Salle constantly neared the
ambuscade. Suddenly a shot was fired. When the
smoke cleared away, La Salle was seen stretched lifeless
upon the prairie. He was quite dead.<a name='FA_112' id='FA_112' href='#FN_112' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> The bullet
had gone through his brain.
</p>

<p>
Thus, in the prime of life, fell Robert Cavelier de La
Salle, and thus again must history record its indignant
protest in the death of a man of highest intellectual
force, whose worth to the world was monumental as compared
with that of the vulgar assassin who slew him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_118' name='Page_118' href='#Page_118'>118</a></span>
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
<span class="smcap">Note.</span>—<span class="smcap">The Colonists at St.
Louis</span>, except three or four who were
carried into captivity, were all massacred
by the Indians. A Spanish expedition in
1689 found the place a solitude. Those
who escaped subsequently related what
had occurred. Although this was the
first white colony to be founded in
Texas,<a name='FA_113' id='FA_113' href='#FN_113' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a> in itself it was an accident, no
less productive of results, because it led
the Spaniards to occupy the country in
order to keep out intruders like La Salle.
Geographical knowledge was also remarkably
extended.

<h4>
IBERVILLE FOUNDS LOUISIANA.
</h4>

<p>
Where La Salle had sowed, others were to reap, yet
so comprehensive were his plans, so well matured, so
entirely feasible withal, that what followed was but the
natural result of his efforts. La Salle was like the general
who falls in the moment of victory. All honor
then to his name!<a name='FA_114' id='FA_114' href='#FN_114' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a>
</p>

<p>
Therefore while we record his failure, individually,
to do all he purposed in this, his last expedition, the
success which came later was due to the master mind
of La Salle. We shall not find, in any explorer of his
time, so original a mind united with such rare gifts for
doing the work to which he devoted himself.
</p>

<p>
For a time, the project of colonizing Louisiana<a name='FA_115' id='FA_115' href='#FN_115' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a>
quietly slept. It was then revived by a naval officer
named Iberville,<a name='FA_116' id='FA_116' href='#FN_116' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> who thus became, in a manner, heir to
La Salle's projects.
</p>

<p>
Iberville promised to rediscover the mouth of the
Mississippi, and hold it afterward by building a fort at
its mouth, just as La Salle would have done if he had
lived to carry out his schemes.
</p>

<p>
Although it had slumbered long, the moment the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_119' name='Page_119' href='#Page_119'>119</a></span>
project was renewed by so capable a man as Iberville,
every intelligent Frenchman saw its importance. The
minister Ponchartrain approved it directly it was
broached to him, the more because he knew that if any
man could succeed in what he undertook, Iberville
would.
</p>

<p>
Iberville had seen much service in Canada, Hudson's
Bay and Newfoundland. Being himself a naval officer
of rank, he would command his own ships, and not be
hampered by a divided command, or the jealousy of a
rival, which had proved such a formidable stumbling-block
to La Salle.
</p>

<p>
As the war was now over, Iberville wished to distinguish
himself by some worthy action done in the interests
of peaceful conquest.
</p>

<p>
Two ships were therefore got ready, which sailed
from Rochefort in October, 1698, and anchored at St.
Domingo<a name='FA_117' id='FA_117' href='#FN_117' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> in December. Sailing thence they fell in
with the Florida coast January 27. A bay opened
before them. Iberville wished to put into this port,
but on attempting to do so he found it in the possession
of three hundred Spaniards from Vera Cruz, whose
commander forbade his landing there. This place was
called Pensacola.<a name='FA_118' id='FA_118' href='#FN_118' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a>
</p>

<p>
Fearing the Spaniards were on the same errand<a name='FA_119' id='FA_119' href='#FN_119' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a>
with himself, Iberville at once made sail for the westward,
hugging the shores as closely as possible in order
not to miss the river among the mists which commonly
hang over and hide it from view. Finding in Mobile
Bay a harbor where his ships could safely ride, while
he himself continued the search along the shore in
boats, Iberville came to an anchor there.
</p>

<p>
Very shortly his exploring parties came to the Pascagoula
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_120' name='Page_120' href='#Page_120'>120</a></span>
River, where they found many savages living.
From this river they pushed on through the intervening
lagoons that everywhere intersect this shallow shore,
till, on the 2d of March, the
Mississippi itself was entered
through one of its numerous
passes.
</p>

<p>
Sailing on up the river, Iberville
passed first one populous
town and then another, receiving
everywhere a cordial
welcome from the savages,
yet doubting within himself
whether he was on the true
Mississippi, till one day a chief
brought him a letter<a name='FA_120' id='FA_120' href='#FN_120' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a> which
Tonty had left for La Salle
thirteen years before, when,
after searching for his chief in
vain, this trusty comrade had
turned back for the Illinois.
</p>

<p>
After mentioning that he
had found La Salle's cross
thrown down, and had set up
another in a better place, the
letter concludes by saying, "It
is a great chagrin to me that
we are going back without finding
you, after having coasted
the Mexican (Louisiana) shore for thirty leagues, and
the Florida twenty-five."
</p>

<div class="figleft">

<img src="images/i-131.jpg" width="150" height="399" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SUGAR PLANT.</p>
</div>

<p>
This letter having removed all Iberville's doubts, he
fell down the river again, and having nowhere found,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_121' name='Page_121' href='#Page_121'>121</a></span>
within sixty leagues of the Gulf, a proper place to
begin a settlement on, he turned back to the Bay of
Biloxi, where a spot was chosen and the ground marked
out for one.
</p>

<p>
After seeing the establishment at Biloxi well under
way, Iberville took ship for France. He was back
again early in January, 1701. During his absence an
English corvette had sailed twenty-five leagues up the
Mississippi to a point where the river sweeps grandly
round to the east. At this place her captain was
warned back by the French, from which circumstance
the bend received the name of the English Turn, which
it has ever since borne.
</p>

<p>
Iberville also learned that English traders from Carolina<a name='FA_121' id='FA_121' href='#FN_121' class='fnanchor'>[8]</a>
had penetrated into the Chickasaw country above
him. Finding himself menaced both by sea and land,
and delay dangerous, Iberville shut up the entrance
from sea by mounting some cannon near the mouth of
the river.
</p>

<p>
The century turned noiselessly on its hinges with
no other establishments in all this great domain of
Louisiana except that planted by La Salle on the Illinois,
and the one at Biloxi.
</p>

<p>
In 1701 Iberville began a settlement at Mobile. The
next year he erected storehouses and barracks on Dauphine
Island<a name='FA_122' id='FA_122' href='#FN_122' class='fnanchor'>[9]</a> for permanent occupation. In a few
years this island became the general headquarters of
the Louisiana colony. Nothing worthy of the name,
however, existed before 1708. Up to this time the
handful of colonists lived on what was sent them from
France, or obtained by trading French goods with the
savages. They sowed wheat, but found the climate too
damp for growing it with success. They also began
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_122' name='Page_122' href='#Page_122'>122</a></span>
the planting of tobacco, which did so well that its
culture presently became a mainstay of the colony.
</p>

<p class="caption">MOUTHS OF THE MISSISSIPPI, AND ADJACENT COASTS.</p>
</div>

<p>
But while Iberville had thus gained a foothold, in
what might be called a good strategic position for
approaching the Mississippi, either from sea or through
Lake Ponchartrain, he was actually but little nearer
than the Spaniards at Pensacola, who kept a watch on
all his movements. Never did nature seem more persistently
thwarting the schemes of men than in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_123' name='Page_123' href='#Page_123'>123</a></span>
attempt of these Frenchmen to enter upon what they
considered their rightful inheritance.

the English from Hudson's Bay.
Afterward he took part in the defence
of Quebec by Frontenac; destroyed
Pemaquid; and took St. John's, Newfoundland.
As a commander he was
almost uniformly successful. Iberville's
name is perpetuated in a town and parish
of Louisiana.

"<i>A soldier, fire, and water, soon make room for themselves.</i>"
</p>

<p>
Iberville died at Havana in 1706, leaving his uncompleted
work to his younger brother, Bienville,<a name='FA_123' id='FA_123' href='#FN_123' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> who
set vigorously about it.
</p>

<p>
Many believed Natchez to be the best point on the
river for founding a settlement. Natchez therefore
assumed importance to French plans for the future.
But Natchez was the principal seat of a powerful nation
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_124' name='Page_124' href='#Page_124'>124</a></span>
whose enmity it would be impolitic to arouse by making
forcible entry upon their lands. An opportunity soon
offered itself, however, which Bienville quickly took
advantage of.
</p>

<p class="caption">BIENVILLE.<br />
<span class="s08">FOUNDER OF NEW ORLEANS, 1718.</span></p>
</div>

<p>
In the first place some outrages committed by the
Natchez upon passing traders gave Bienville the pretext
he sought for building a fort
at their village, which was
promptly done (1714).
</p>

<p>
These people being overawed,
the next step taken
was the building of a fortified
house at Natchitoches,<a name='FA_124' id='FA_124' href='#FN_124' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a>
on the Red River, as a
check to the Spaniards, who,
already, were working their
way east from the Rio
Grande toward the Mississippi,
partly to overawe the
troublesome Comanches, and
partly to engross the Indian
trade of that region for
themselves. Thus early in
its history the Mississippi
and its commerce were become
a bone of contention
between English, Spaniards and French.
</p>

<p>
Again the folly of farming out the trade of a whole
country to a single individual, which had been tried
in Canada with such bad effects, was repeated here in
Louisiana. This monopoly was granted (1712) to
Anthony Crozat for twenty-five years. Like all speculators,
Crozat aimed to make the most in the shortest
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_125' name='Page_125' href='#Page_125'>125</a></span>
time, letting the future of the colony take care of itself.
He was to control, absolutely, all that came into the
colony or went out of it. Agriculture was neglected
and trade only encouraged. And all trade was monopolized
by Anthony Crozat. This was the penny wise,
pound foolish, colonial system of France, adopted with
the purpose of putting a little money into the royal
treasury at a nominal saving to it of certain sums
required for maintaining its authority in the colony.
This policy turned the colony into a trading-post, and
the people themselves into dependants of Crozat.
</p>

<p>
When Crozat entered upon his exclusive privileges
there were but twenty-eight families in the whole province,
of whom not more than half were actual settlers,
the rest being either traders, innkeepers or laborers,
who had no fixed residence.
</p>

<p>
The roving traders, or <i>Coureurs de Bois</i>,<a name='FA_125' id='FA_125' href='#FN_125' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> bartered
French goods with the Indians for peltries and slaves,
which were sold in the settlements. It was found that
tobacco, indigo, cotton and rice could be profitably
cultivated, but none except slaves were employed in
tilling the soil, which, indeed, is comparatively worthless
in the neighborhood where the colonists first located
themselves. Consequently only such things as would
help to eke out a subsistence—such as corn, vegetables
and poultry—were cultivated at all. In a word, the
colony literally lived from hand to mouth. Instead of
growing stronger and richer, of its own robust growth,
it grew, if possible, weaker and poorer by reason of
a policy, or system, under which no colony has ever
thrived.
</p>

<p>
Little inducement was held out for the colonist to
identify himself with the country, or feel that he and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_126' name='Page_126' href='#Page_126'>126</a></span>
it must grow up together. He was a sojourner in a
strange land. He could never hope to get rich by
trade, since every thing must pass through the hands
of Crozat's agents, at a price fixed by them.
</p>

<p>
This was by no means the whole weakness of Louisiana
in her infancy. Perhaps the primary evil lay in
the fact that so
far the French
neither controlled
access to
the Mississippi,
in the place
where they were,
or had formed
any settled plan
for securing that
solid foothold on
its banks which
alone could render
them masters
of the situation.
</p>

<p>
Crozat's failure
was, in the
nature of things,
foreordained. His scheme, indeed, proved a stumbling-block
to the colony and a loss to himself. In five years
(1717) he was glad to surrender his monopoly to the
crown.
</p>

</div>

<p>
From its ashes sprung the gigantic Mississippi Scheme
of John Law,<a name='FA_126' id='FA_126' href='#FN_126' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> to whom all Louisiana, now including
the Illinois country, was granted for a term of years.
Compared with this prodigality Crozat's concession was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_127' name='Page_127' href='#Page_127'>127</a></span>
but a plaything. It not only gave Law's Company
proprietary rights to the soil, but power was conferred
to administer justice, make peace or war with
the natives, build forts, levy troops and with consent
of the crown to appoint such military governors as it
should think fitting. These extraordinary privileges
were put in force by a royal edict, dated in September,
1717.
</p>

<p>
The new company granted lands along the river to
individuals or associated persons, who were sometimes
actual emigrants, sometimes great personages who sent
out colonists at their own cost, or again the company
itself undertook the building up of plantations or lands
reserved by it for the purpose. One colony of Alsatians
was sent out by Law to begin a plantation on
the Arkansas.<a name='FA_127' id='FA_127' href='#FN_127' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> Others, more or less flourishing, were
located at the mouth of the Yazoo, Natchez and Baton
Rouge. All were agricultural plantations, though in
most cases the plantations themselves consisted of a
few poor huts covered with a thatch of palm-leaves.
The earliest forts were usually a square earthwork,
strengthened with palisades about the parapet.
</p>

<p>
The company's agricultural system was founded upon
African slave labor.<a name='FA_128' id='FA_128' href='#FN_128' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a> Slaves were brought from St.
Domingo or other of the West India islands. By some
their employment was viewed with alarm, because it
was thought the blacks would soon outnumber the
whites, and might some day rise and overpower them;
but we find only the feeblest protest entered against
the moral wrong of slavery in any record of the time.
Negroes could work in the fields, under the burning
sun, when the whites could not. Their labor cost no
more than their maintenance. The planters easily
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_128' name='Page_128' href='#Page_128'>128</a></span>
adopted what, indeed, already existed among their
neighbors. Self-interest stifled conscience.
</p>

<p>
The new company wisely appointed Bienville governor.
Three ships brought munitions, troops, and
stores of every sort from France, with which to put new
life into the expiring colony.
</p>

<p>
It was at this time (February, 1718) that Bienville
began the foundation of the destined metropolis of
Louisiana. The spot chosen by him was clearly but a
fragment of the delta which the river had been for ages
silently building of its own mud and driftwood. It had
literally risen from the sea. Elevated only a few feet
above sea-level, threatened with frequent inundation,
and in its primitive estate a cypress swamp, it seemed
little suited for the abode of men, yet time has confirmed
the wisdom of the choice.
</p>

<p>
Here, then, a hundred miles from the Gulf, on the
alluvial banks of the great river, twenty-five convicts
and as many carpenters were set to work clearing the
ground and building the humble log cabins, which were
to constitute the capital, in its infancy.
</p>

<p>
The settlement was named New Orleans,<a name='FA_129' id='FA_129' href='#FN_129' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a> in honor of
the Regent, Orleans, who ruled France during the
minority of Louis XV.
</p>

<p>
Up to this time it was supposed that large ships
could not cross the bar, at the river's mouth, but upon
sounding the channel, enough water was found to float
one of the company's ships, which then sailed up to
New Orleans. From this day, the river may be said
to have been fairly open to commerce with the outside
world. As respects the passage up and down, it had
practically become an every-day excursion for the Canadian
voyageurs who, with the Indians, had so long
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_129' name='Page_129' href='#Page_129'>129</a></span>
formed its floating population. These adventurers now
drew up their canoes, along the bank, at New Orleans,
whose promiscuous assemblage of Indians, habitants,
convicts, soldiers and priests, they joined.
</p>

<p>
Father Charlevoix, the historian of New France, thus
describes New Orleans as he saw it in 1721:—
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"The most just idea I can give you is to imagine two hundred
persons who have been sent to build a city, and who are encamped
on its banks. This city is the first which one of the greatest rivers
of the world has seen rise on its borders. It is composed of a hundred
barracks placed without much order, a large storehouse built
of wood, two or three houses which would not adorn a poor village
in France, and part of a wretched barrack which they have been
willing to lend the Lord, for his service, and of which He had
scarcely taken possession when He was thrust out and made to
take shelter under a tent."

founding of Louisiana are fittingly perpetuated.

Louis XIV. was not only, as Richelieu, powerful, but

sovereign in every acceptation of the word; central
monarch of civilization; pivot of all Europe, seeing, so

</p>

<p>
We should expect to find a race of sailors pushing
discovery on their own element.
</p>

<p>
With English mariners of the seventeenth century,
the belief in a North-west Passage to India was an inherited
faith. Cabot led discovery in this direction.
It became, almost exclusively, a field for the brave and
adventurous of this nation who, from year to year,
spreading their tattered sails to the frozen blasts of the
Polar Sea, grimly fought their way on from cape to
headland, in desperate venture, lured by the vain hope
of finding the open waters of their dreams lying just
beyond them. It is a story of daring and peril unsurpassed.
Many a noble ship and gallant crew have gone
down while attempting to solve those mysteries which
the hand of God would seem forever to have sealed up
from the knowledge of man.
</p>

<p>
Among others the brave and ill-fated Henry Hudson,<a name='FA_130' id='FA_130' href='#FN_130' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a>
in 1610, sailed through the straits leading into the
bay now bearing his name, where his mutinous crew
wickedly abandoned him to die of cold or hunger, or
both.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_133' name='Page_133' href='#Page_133'>133</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Afterward, Hudson's Bay was repeatedly visited by
English navigators whose discoveries all went to confirm
the prevailing belief in an open polar sea. One
of them even took a letter from his own king for the
Emperor of Japan. In view of the suffering to which
all were alike subject, these "frost-biting voyages"
might be said to show more heroism than sound practical
wisdom, yet with the riches of the Indies spread out
before their fancy, and all England to applaud their
deeds, the best of England's sailors were always ready
to peril life
and limb for
the prize. All
who came
back told the
same tale,—of
seas sheeted
in ice, suns
that never
set, lands
where nothing
grew, cold
so extreme that all nature seemed but a mockery of the
all-wise design of the Creator Himself.
</p>

<p class="caption">ABANDONED HUT, NORTH-WEST COAST.</p>
</div>

<p>
Sir Thomas Button followed up Hudson's discoveries
in 1612. He wintered at the mouth of Nelson's River,
so named by him, after finding farther progress to the
westward barred by the coast, where he had hoped to
find it opening before him.
</p>

<p>
It was soon found that the bleak and desolate region
enclosing Hudson's Bay was rich in fur-bearing animals,
whose skins bore a great price in Europe, and the reports
brought back from that far-off land gave a certain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_134' name='Page_134' href='#Page_134'>134</a></span>
Frenchman named Grosselier the idea of planting a
fur-trading colony there. He at once went to the minister
with his plan. The minister, however, would not
listen to him. Grosselier then went to Prince Rupert,<a name='FA_131' id='FA_131' href='#FN_131' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a>
who was staying at Paris, to ask for the aid he wanted.
Struck with the scheme, the prince became its patron.
A ship was sent out, with Grosselier, in 1668, which
reached the head of James' Bay,<a name='FA_132' id='FA_132' href='#FN_132' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> where Fort Charles
was built. The next year, Prince Rupert, and seventeen
others, were incorporated into a company, with
power granted them to make settlements and carry on
trade in Hudson's Bay.
</p>

<p>
In this way the since famous Hudson's Bay Company
obtained a monopoly of the fur-trade of all that
region, which afterward proved so valuable to it. Its
powers were most ample. It could hold and convey
land, fit out ships, erect forts, or make war with the
peoples of that country, but all this was to be done in
its character as a trading-company; and though it had a
resident governor, the central authority was kept in the
company, in London, who continued to direct its affairs.
</p>

<p>
In the earlier years of its existence the Hudson's
Bay Company had a hard struggle for life. We know
that French traders formerly had dealings with the
natives of that dreary inland sea. Jealousy now
prompted them to try to drive the English thence by
force, and so get rid of their rivalry. To this end repeated
attacks were made upon the English factories,<a name='FA_133' id='FA_133' href='#FN_133' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a>
which were taken and retaken, first by one and then by
another assailant. Even in time of peace the French
had not scrupled to assault these remote posts, so unwilling
were Canadians to see the English gain a foothold
in that quarter.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_135' name='Page_135' href='#Page_135'>135</a></span>
</p>

<p>
These invasions were quieted at last by the treaty of
Utrecht (1713), which left the English in possession
of what they had battled with foes of every sort to
secure for themselves.
</p>

<p>
Communication had with the natives, who were
nomads, taught the English how to make distant journeys,
and gradually, with their aid, to penetrate farther
and farther into the interior. But to live in the country
at all, they had, in a great measure, to adapt themselves
to the natives' way of life, and to make journeys they had
to adopt the rude conveyances found in use among them.

"<i>Many a shoal marks this stern coast.</i>"
</p>

<p>
The Hudson's Bay Company's grant was meant to
promote the discovery of a North-west Passage to India:
so the people of England, in giving away such large
privileges, expected this would be done without delay.
</p>

<p>
But the company, at first, made little or no effort in
this direction. It was chiefly occupied with making
money, and making it from the start. Hence every
thing was made to work to that end.
</p>

</div>

<p>
England did not know what she was doing when she
created this monopoly. Ignorance led to delusion, and
delusion to the inconsiderate granting away of an empire.
It was thought the company would explore and
settle its grant, and thus England would reap the benefits
without spending a penny. The company, on the
other hand, meant to do nothing of the sort, unless
driven to it by popular clamor. Then it would do as
little as it could. Colonization was fatal to the fur-trade,
and the company was an association of fur-traders,
nothing else.
Hence, given
a warehouse
in London, a
ship to carry
goods back
and forth, a port and factory at Hudson's Bay, a score
or more of trading-posts scattered here and there over
a vast extent of territory, to which the hunters could
bring furs and get goods at the company's price, and
we have, briefly told, the whole machinery of this giant
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_137' name='Page_137' href='#Page_137'>137</a></span>
monopoly. In dealing with the outside world it pursued
a policy of Spanish exclusion and silence. It was
not making history, but money.
</p>

<p>
Yet the company was all the time building better
than it knew, for even the coming and going of its own
traders gradually enlarged geographical knowledge of
the country, so smoothing the way for the future.
</p>

<p>
From time to time the natives who came to the factories
showed specimens of copper ore, which they said
came from the Far Off Metal River of the North. The
English traders consequently named it the Coppermine.
It became an object with them to find the mine, or
mines, whence these specimens had been taken. The
governor accordingly (1769) sent one of his most trusty
men into the unknown wilderness in search of them.
</p>

<p>
Taking with him some Indian guides, and living as
they lived, that is to say one day fasting and the next
feasting, as game was found plenty or scarce, Samuel
Hearne only succeeded in getting to the Coppermine
after making three attempts to do so. His story is a
wondrous record of persevering endurance. He found
the sacred character of the calumet everywhere acknowledged,
even by the most degraded tribes. When
they had once smoked together the stranger was as safe
from injury or insult as in his own house, though
nothing could exceed the curiosity which his white skin,
blue eyes and light hair, all so different from their own,
caused among the Indians he met in his journey.
</p>

<p>
The Coppermine was found to run into the Arctic
Ocean, instead of Hudson's Bay, as Hearne supposed it
did when he first set out, but no copper could be discovered
worth the taking of such a journey to look for,
as his. Hearne came back (1772) at the end of a year
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_138' name='Page_138' href='#Page_138'>138</a></span>
and a half, having established the shore line of the
northern ocean at a point where land only was supposed
to be. This was considered a great geographical discovery.
Thus, year by year, a little was added here
and a little there toward completing an accurate map
of the north coast line.
</p>

<p>
In 1789, a Scotch trader, named Alexander Mackenzie,
had been living for eight years past at Fort
Chipewyan.<a name='FA_134' id='FA_134' href='#FN_134' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> This was a station nearly central between
Hudson's Bay and the Pacific. Mackenzie was an explorer
by instinct. He determined to cross the continent.
Once he had made up his mind, no thought of
hardship could deter him. His course through the
Slave River and lakes led him to the river now bearing
his own name,—the Mackenzie River. Down this
stream the intrepid traveller floated in his frail canoe, to
its outlet upon the frozen Arctic Sea.
</p>

<p>
During his trip, Mackenzie questioned the Indians of
this river about the unknown country lying beyond the
great western wall of mountains, but found they could
tell him little except that the people of that country
were so exceeding fierce no stranger durst go among
them. But Mackenzie knew the Pacific was there, and
meant to reach it.
</p>

<p>
He first moved up from Fort Chipewyan to the east
foot of the mountains, so as to get a better start. He
wintered here. In the spring (1793), he was ready to
set out again. One large, strong canoe, which held all
the provisions, and which two men could carry with
ease, enabled the travellers to work their slow and toilsome
way up the swollen mountain torrents into the
highest defiles, from which they sprung. As the explorers
advanced, the stream they were ascending became
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_139' name='Page_139' href='#Page_139'>139</a></span>
more and more choked up with rocks or fallen
trees, and more and more broken by cascades and
rapids. It was often necessary to carry the canoe
round or drag it over these obstructions, though at the
cost of such toil that the men grew disheartened and
wished to turn back, thinking the task a hopeless one.
Unsparing of himself, Mackenzie put courage into the
downhearted, and after a short rest all
were ready to go on again.
</p>

<img src="images/i-150.jpg" width="150" height="199" alt="" />
<p class="caption">INDIAN MASK, WEST COAST.</p>
</div>

<p>
Falling, at length, among the Indians
who dwelt among the mountains, Mackenzie
found that the rest of the journey
would be much shortened by leaving
his canoes and proceeding by land. He
therefore continued his way by land,
constantly meeting with natives who
lived sumptuously on the salmon that the streams
everywhere produced in great abundance and perfection.
Mackenzie soon found he had nothing to fear
from these people. They fed and sheltered his men in
their villages, and willingly helped him on his way.
The fatigues and anxieties of the journey were nearly
past, for on the 23d of July, 1793, the party of white
men arrived on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, near
the Straits of Fuca.
</p>

<p>
Although, in relating the adventures of Mackenzie,
we have gone somewhat before our story, the doing so
is essential to its design, as subsequent chapters will
show.

<h4>
THE RUSSIANS IN ALASKA.

<p class="center">
"<i>Heaven is high and the Czar distant.</i>"
</p>

<p>
Referring to what Drake had done for England,
and De Fuca for Spain, the one tacking a name to the
coast here, the other there, we find little for more than
a century going to show that Europeans thought the
discoveries of either worth following up.
</p>

<p>
What do we then see? Not Spain, not England putting
forth a steady hand to grasp the prize each already
claimed as its own, but a new power, coming not
from the East,
but from the
West. It is a
power hardly
known in Europe.
It is
Russia.
</p>

<p class="caption">SEALS, ST. PAUL'S ISLAND.</p>
</div>

<p>
The Czar
Peter, Peter
the Great in
history, determined
to know whether the two grand continents,
Asia and America, were joined in one, or separated by a
northern ocean. Peter died before the orders given for
this purpose could be carried out, but Catherine, his
empress and successor, sent Captain Behring<a name='FA_135' id='FA_135' href='#FN_135' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> of the
royal navy to execute them.
</p>

<p>
Sailing from Kamschatka (1728), Behring followed
the coast of Asia round to the north-west, finding open
water everywhere, and so determining the separation of
the continents. In a second voyage (1741) he put out
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_141' name='Page_141' href='#Page_141'>141</a></span>
to sea, this time falling in with the American coast, discovering
Mt. St. Elias and the Aleutian archipelago.
</p>

<p>
During this voyage Behring's vessel was thrown
upon an island and wrecked, and he himself died miserably
there, but some of his sailors built themselves a
vessel out of the wreck, in which they succeeded in getting
back to Kamschatka, bringing with them the furs of
the sea-otters and foxes they
had killed and eaten while
living upon the desert island.
</p>

<div class="figright">

<p class="caption">RUSSIAN CHURCH, ALASKA.</p>
</div>

<p>
From the
time of these
discoveries,
Russian adventurers,
who were little better
than daring
freebooters,
crossed over
the narrow seas
to the Aleutian
Isles, to kill the sea-otters for their fur, thus opening
between them and Ochotsk, and between Ochotsk and
the Chinese frontier, next Siberia, by means of caravans,
a trade in the valuable furs for which these islands
are so famous.
</p>

<p>
In time, these roving traders were followed by a few
actual colonists, who were brought over from Siberia or
Kamschatka to aid in establishing permanent trading-posts<a name='FA_136' id='FA_136' href='#FN_136' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a>
at suitable points. But the country possessed no
other resources except its fur-trade. The early traders
had cruelly oppressed the natives, hence the first colonists
were looked upon as enemies, and treated as such
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_142' name='Page_142' href='#Page_142'>142</a></span>
by them. Some missionaries of the Greek Church were
also sent over to care for the souls of these poor people,
who before had no knowledge of Christianity.
</p>

<p>
There were no elements of thrift in this colony, consequently
it could never make healthy progress. At
best the people were little better than vassals, while the
Indians were hardly more than slaves. The land is too
cold for agriculture. The people have but one occupation,
that of seal-hunting.
</p>

<p>
The fur-trade was at first conducted by private persons,
but eventually the control passed to one large
company, sanctioned by the crown under the form of
The Russian American Company, with headquarters
first at Kodiak and then at Sitka.<a name='FA_137' id='FA_137' href='#FN_137' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a>
</p>

<p>
This company claimed the whole coast of America,
on the Pacific, with the adjacent islands, from Behring
Straits southward to, and beyond, the mouth of the
Columbia River.

<h4>
ENGLAND ON THE PACIFIC.
</h4>

<p class="center">
"<i>Ye mariners of England!</i>"—<i>Campbell</i>.
</p>

<p>
England's conquest of Canada<a name='FA_138' id='FA_138' href='#FN_138' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> (1763) put a wholly
new face upon the situation in America. She was now,
beyond dispute, the foremost power of this continent.
</p>

<p>
Hardly had the echoes of this conflict died away,
when a new power arose to contend with England for
what she had just torn from the grasp of France. This
was her own American colonies, whose people had now
been driven to take up arms (1775) against the mother
country, in defence of their dearest political rights. So
England gained Canada, but lost her own colonies.
She wrested power from France, only to see it snatched
from her own grasp in the moment of victory, though,
after all, it was no less a victory for the English-speaking
race over all her Latin-speaking rivals. It must be
seen that events like these would have far-reaching
effects in shaping our history.
</p>

<p>
Yet while the conflict with her colonies was going on,
and both parties were in the thick of the actual fighting,
England was putting forth efforts to control the
commerce of the North-west Coast.
</p>

<p>
For this purpose it would be essential to have accurate
surveys of all important harbors and sounds, in
order to select sites for future settlements, and above
all of any navigable rivers flowing from the east out
upon the coast, that might afford a practicable route
into the interior, and so connect this coast with the
settlements of the Hudson's Bay Company.
</p>

<p>
With this end in view, two discovery ships were sent
out (1776), in command of Captain James Cook,<a name='FA_139' id='FA_139' href='#FN_139' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_144' name='Page_144' href='#Page_144'>144</a></span>
orders to search the coast of New Albion for any navigable
river north of the forty-fifth parallel. England
clearly meant to re-assert her claim to sovereignty,<a name='FA_140' id='FA_140' href='#FN_140' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> set
up so long ago in her behalf by Sir Francis Drake.
</p>

<p>
On board Cook's ship were two persons with whom
our story will have to deal. One was Midshipman
Vancouver, the other Corporal Ledyard of the marines.
</p>

<div class="figleft">
<a name="i-155" id="i-155"></a>
<img src="images/i-155.jpg" width="220" height="61" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SNOW SPECTACLES, ALASKA.</p>
</div>

<p>
Cook first discovered
and named
the Sandwich Islands.<a name='FA_141' id='FA_141' href='#FN_141' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a>
Shaping his
course thence for
the American coast, he fell in with (1778) and named
Cape Flattery.<a name='FA_142' id='FA_142' href='#FN_142' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> Steering now northward with the coast
always in sight, Cook at length found a broad basin,
which the Indians called Nootka, and which has since
been known as Nootka Sound.<a name='FA_143' id='FA_143' href='#FN_143' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a> The ships lay
here all the month of April, refitting, and getting
ready for the coming cruise in the arctic
seas, which Cook was instructed to explore for
the wished-for passage into Hudson's Bay.
</p>

<div class="figright">
<a name="i-155b" id="i-155b"></a>
<img src="images/i-155b.jpg" width="61" height="296" alt="" />
<p class="caption">INDIAN CARVING.</p>
</div>

<p>
Except for their propensity to steal, which
nothing could control, Cook found the natives
of Nootka a friendly people, though they were
no longer abashed in the presence of white men,
or afraid of their loud-roaring cannon, as in
the time of Drake. Many wore brass or silver
trinkets. Most of them had tools of iron which
they had made for themselves, and could use
with skill. Passing ships would therefore seem
to have brought these tribes into unfrequent
communication with Europeans, so that Cook's coming
neither surprised nor intimidated them; while the articles
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_145' name='Page_145' href='#Page_145'>145</a></span>
in their possession acquainted him with the fact
that other navigators had passed that way before him,
perhaps with views similar to his own.
</p>

<p>
Upon again setting sail, Cook was blown off the coast
by contrary winds. When he again saw it, he was far
to the north of Nootka. He saw and named Mt. Edgecumbe
as he sailed; then Mt. St. Elias rose in solitary
grandeur before them, giving Cook notice that he was
now crossing the track of the Russian discoverers.
</p>

<div class="figright">

<img src="images/i-156.jpg" width="200" height="214" alt="" />
<p class="caption">INDIAN GRAVE, NORTH-WEST COAST.</p>
</div>

<p>
The ships continued to skirt
the coast until its westward
trend forced them to put about,
and steer south-west, along the
shores of the Alaskan peninsula.
Cook had missed both
the Columbia River and the
Straits of Fuca, thus
losing his one chance
for making known to the
world the great water
systems of the north
Pacific.
</p>

<p>
Getting clear of Alaska,
Cook came to Oonalaska, of the Aleutian group,
which he doubled. Then, finding the coast beyond him
to bend in the desired direction, again he sailed on
through Behring's Straits into the Arctic Ocean as far
as Icy Cape (70° 29´), at which point his ships were
stopped by ice. Finding he could go no farther, he put
about and returned to Oonalaska, where, in October,
he anchored.
</p>

<p>
From this anchorage Corporal Ledyard was sent on
shore in search of the Russian traders, then known to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_146' name='Page_146' href='#Page_146'>146</a></span>
be living on the island, whom he found, and brought
back with him to the ships. Getting little from these
people, for want of interpreters, Cook sailed back to
the Sandwich Islands, where the natives of Owyhee
treacherously killed him while he was on shore.
</p>

<p>
The furs which Cook's sailors obtained from the
natives of Nootka, in exchange for knives, buttons and
other trifles, were sold at Canton, China, for more than
ten thousand dollars. This was the beginning of a
trade between Nootka and Canton, which, during the
next decade, was the means of bringing many British
vessels to the North-west Coast.
</p>

<p>
It is instructive to remember that, at the very time
when the American colonies were throwing off their
allegiance, Cook was quietly exploring the North-west
Coast, in the interests of peaceful expansion, which, in
the end, was to inure to the benefit of those colonies.

<h4>
QUEEN ELIZABETH.
</h4>

<p>
Though Elizabeth was so well calculated to govern
with ability, and even with that glory and advantage
to her people which England had never witnessed
under any of its preceding sovereigns;—though her
administration was so vigorously and equitably exercised,
and all her plans and negotiations so ably and
successfully conducted;—though, in short, she was
equally revered and obeyed, as a sovereign, at home,
and she was feared and respected abroad;—yet was
Elizabeth a very weak and silly woman in trifling concerns.
She seemed a Goliath in the conduct of the
mighty affairs of empires; but dwindled into a very
woman, when the color, fancy, or fashion of a dress
became the topic. Nor was she free from the little
petty vexations, jealousies, and rivalship of beauty, so
natural to her sex. Indeed, it appears that she hated
and envied her cousin, the beautiful Mary of Scots,
less on account of her pretensions to the crown, than
for her superior charms. When Mary sent Sir James
Melville to London, to endeavor to establish a good
understanding with Elizabeth, he was instructed by
Mary to sound her cousin on subjects that would interest
her rather as a woman than a queen. "He accordingly
succeeded so well," says Hume, "that he threw
that artful princess entirely off her guard, and made
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_148' name='Page_148' href='#Page_148'>148</a></span>
her discover the bottom of her heart, full of those
vanities, and follies, and ideas of rivalship, which possess
the youngest and most frivolous of her sex. He
talked to her of his travels, and forgot not to mention
the different
dresses
of the ladies
in different
countries; and
she took
care thenceforth
to
meet the
ambassador

to be the best color of hair; she asked whether his
queen or she had the finest color of hair; she even inquired
which of them he esteemed the fairest person,—a
very delicate question, and which he prudently
eluded, by saying that her majesty was the fairest

next demanded which of them was tallest. He replied,
his queen. 'Then she is too tall,' said Elizabeth, 'for I
myself am of a just stature.'"

<h4>
INTERLUDE.—WHAT JONATHAN CARVER AIMED TO DO
IN 1766.
</h4>

<p>
It so happened, that after the conquest of Canada,
an American, and veteran of that war, named Jonathan
Carver, conceived the idea of crossing the continent by
way of the Great Lakes and tributaries of the Mississippi.
After attentively studying the French maps,
and reading the accounts of Hennepin and Lahontan,
he believed this could be done.
</p>

<p>
Carver's avowed purpose was, first, to ascertain the
breadth of the continent. If successful in reaching
the Pacific, he meant to have proposed to the English
government the establishment of a permanent port on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_150' name='Page_150' href='#Page_150'>150</a></span>
that coast. He was convinced that this was the true
way to the discovery of the North-west Passage, which
Drake had attempted so long ago, justly reasoning that
it would be easier to sail from the west than from the
east, while the loss of time consequent upon the long
voyages from England, with the delays and perils incident
to Arctic navigation, would be much lessened by
having such a dépôt as he proposed. And it would also
greatly facilitate communication between Hudson's Bay
and the Pacific.
</p>

<p>
Carver thought further, that a settlement on that side
of the continent would not only open up new sources
of trade, and, to use his own words, also "promote
many useful discoveries, but would open a way for conveying
intelligence to China and the English settlements
in the East Indies with greater expedition than
a tedious voyage by the Cape of Good Hope, or the
Straits of Magellan, would allow of."
</p>

<p>
Whether it originated in his own brain or not, so far
as known, Carver was the first boldly to set before the
English people the idea of going across the American
continent to India,—the idea that has eventually solved
the whole problem.
</p>

<p>
Convinced that his undertaking was practicable, Carver
started from Michilimackinac in September, 1766,
in company with some traders who were going among
the Sioux by the old route leading through Green Bay,
Fox River and the Wisconsin. What he could learn
about the upper tributaries of the Mississippi seems to
have determined Carver to fix his final starting-point
somewhere about the Falls of St. Anthony.
</p>

<p>
These falls were reached on the 17th of November.
When Carver came to the point overlooking them, his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_151' name='Page_151' href='#Page_151'>151</a></span>
Indian guide surprised him by beginning to chant aloud
an invocation to the spirit of the waters. While doing
this he was stripping off first one, then another, of his
ornaments, and casting them from him into the stream.
First he threw in his pipe, then his tobacco, then the
bracelets he wore on his arms and wrists, and lastly
his necklace and ear-rings. When he had thus divested
himself of every article of value
he possessed, the Indian concluded
his prayer of adoration
with which his propitiatory offerings
were so freely joined. Carver's
journey, in this direction,
ended at the River St. Francis. Returning south he
ascended the St. Peter's, or Minnesota River, by his own
account, for a distance of two hundred miles, to the
villages of the Sioux with whom he passed the winter.
</p>

<p class="caption">FALLS OF ST. ANTHONY.</p>
</div>

<p>
But after thus penetrating far into what is now the
State of Minnesota, Carver found himself unable to
proceed. The gifts that were to be sent after him, and
which were essential to securing a safe-conduct among
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_152' name='Page_152' href='#Page_152'>152</a></span>
the Indian nations on his route, did not come. No
alternative therefore remained but to go back to Prairie
du Chien, the great Indian trading-mart of all that
region, where the explorer finally gave up the attempt
to go west at this time. He then returned to Canada
by way of the St. Croix and Lake Superior, bringing
with him the information gained by a seven months'
residence among the
Sioux.
</p>

<p>
Carver's Travels
were published in England
in 1778, ten years
after his return, although
his notes and
maps had been in the
government's possession
for some years,
permission to publish
them having been refused
him.

<p>
It is here that we
first find the name of
Oregon,<a name='FA_144' id='FA_144' href='#FN_144' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> given to the
great river of the Pacific
slope. Carver speaks of it repeatedly as "the
river of the West that falls into the Pacific Ocean."
</p>

<p>
This explorer afterward (1774) decided to renew the
effort to cross America, his indicated route being up
the St. Peter's to its head, thence across to the Missouri,
up this stream to its source, and, after discovering
the source of the "Oregon or River of the West, on the
other side the summit of the dividing highlands," to
descend it to the sea. His purpose was frustrated by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_153' name='Page_153' href='#Page_153'>153</a></span>
the war between England and the colonies. He has,
however, put on record his opinion touching the future
of the great Mississippi valley. This is his prophecy:
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"To what power or authority this new world will become dependent,
after it has arisen from its present uncultivated state,
time alone can discover. But as the seat of empire, from time
immemorial, has been gradually progressive towards the west, there
is no doubt but that at some future period, mighty kingdoms will
emerge from these wildernesses, and stately palaces, and solemn
temples, with gilded spires, reaching the skies, supplant the Indian
huts whose only decorations are the barbarous trophies of their
vanquished enemies."

<p class='footnote' id='FN_144'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_144'>[1]</a></span> <span class="smcap">Oregon.</span> What were Carver's
sources of information about this river?
The Sioux told Father Charlevoix forty
odd years earlier (1721), that by going
up the Missouri, as high as possible, a
great river would be found running west,
into the sea. Carver, we know, had read
Charlevoix's work. Yet the Sioux may
have told him the same story, which he
so constantly reiterates in his own narrative,
and we know it to be a true story.
Substantially, Carver followed the same
route which Marquette, Hennepin, and
others had before him. This may have
cast doubts upon the validity of all he
has given, as of his own knowledge.
But the main facts came within the ken
of so many persons, who could have
stamped them as spurious, but did not,
that we think their validity must be
granted.
</p>
<p class="footnote">
But what is the origin of the name
<span class="smcap">Oregon</span> first used by Carver? Here we
are all at sea. Bonneville says the word
comes from Oregano, which he asserts
to have been the early Spanish name for
the Columbia River country—derived
from oreganum, the botanical name for
the wild-sage plant, or artemisia. This
seems hardly conclusive. Again, we
know the Spaniards gave the name Los
Organos (Organ Mountains) to a range
of the Sierra Madre, so it is possible
they may have applied it indefinitely to
the whole chain, north of New Mexico.
But the Sioux could hardly have known
of either derivation, or Carver have invented
the name.

<div class="chapter">
<h4>
JOHN LEDYARD'S IDEA.
</h4>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Corporal John Ledyard's</span><a name='FA_145' id='FA_145' href='#FN_145' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> fancy had been taken
captive by the exploits of Captain Cook, which for a
time fairly renewed the enthusiasm Drake's bold dash
into the far South Sea had created so long before.
</p>

<p>
Ledyard was a born explorer. Every thing he saw
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_154' name='Page_154' href='#Page_154'>154</a></span>
while under Cook's command was jotted down from
day to day in his diary. He was quick-witted, restless,
and ambitious of making his way in the world, nor was
he slow to see the advantage that the north-west coast
offered to whomsoever should be first in the field. But
Ledyard had been wearing King George's uniform,
though himself an American, whom thirst for new
scenes had led to enlist under a hostile flag. When,
however, after his return to England, Ledyard was sent
out to America, rather than fight against his country
he deserted.
</p>

<p>
His mind was filled with crude projects for securing
the commerce of the north-west coast, not for England,
but for America, and America was now a free republic.
So he had imbibed at least the spirit of what is now
known as the Monroe Doctrine.
</p>

<p>
Ledyard first tried to get American merchants to fit
out a ship for him. Failing in this he went to France,
thinking to secure there the help he wanted.
</p>

<p>
It happened that while Ledyard was trying to get up
a company to carry on his schemes, Louis XVI. was
fitting out La Peyrouse to follow up Cook's track in
the Pacific, and so make good what that eminent navigator
had failed to make complete.
</p>

<p>
Ledyard importuned everybody. Haunting those
who would listen to him, borrowing money first from
one and then another in order to live, sometimes without
a crown in his pocket, always repulsed, but never
despairing, the would-be explorer woke and slept on
his one ever-present idea.
</p>

<p>
"I die with anxiety," he says to a friend, "to be on
the back of the American States, after having penetrated
to the Pacific Ocean. There is an extensive
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_155' name='Page_155' href='#Page_155'>155</a></span>
field for the acquirement of honest fame. The American
Revolution invites to a thorough discovery of the
continent. It was necessary that a European should
discover America, but in the name of love of country
let a native explore its resources and boundaries. It is
my wish to be that man."
</p>

<p>
Thomas Jefferson was, at this time (1785), our minister
to France, "in every word and deed the representative
of a young, vigorous and determined state."
Ledyard often sought his counsel and aid. Struck by
Ledyard's uncommon devotion to his one idea, Jefferson
said to him one day, "Why not go by land to Kamschatka,
cross over in some of the Russian vessels to
Nootka Sound, fall down into the latitude of the Missouri,
and penetrate to and through that to the United
States?"
</p>

<p>
This conversation curiously shows us that, at the time
the American Union was first formed, more was known
about Kamschatka than about the region lying between
the Mississippi and the Pacific Ocean. Through Siberia,
at least, there was a travelled route, while from
the Mississippi to the Pacific there was none. The conversation
is therefore an instructive starting-point in the
history of our country.
</p>

<p>
Although the enterprise itself failed to bear fruit at
this time, the coming together of these two men, one of
whom became the apostle of the American idea in its
broadest sense, was like the striking together of flint
and steel. Fire followed it. Ledyard had the best
knowledge of the subject. Ledyard pointed out the
way. Ledyard had given Jefferson something to ponder,
which, in his sagacious mind, soon grew to a question
of highest national importance.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_156' name='Page_156' href='#Page_156'>156</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Ledyard eagerly agreed to make the trial, provided
that the Russian Government would give its consent.
This being granted, the explorer set out for Kamschatka;
but at Irkutsk, in Siberia, he was stopped and
turned back, in consequence of the jealousy of the Russian-American
Company, whose headquarters were at
Irkutsk, and who feared their interests would be endangered
if this daring stranger were permitted to pass into
their territory.
</p>

<p>
From this time Ledyard's personal history ceases to
be associated with that of the Great West. But he was
the first to perceive, perhaps dimly, what was shortly
to become, with a broader growth, the ruling idea of
American statesmen.

to Dartmouth College to be fitted as an
Indian missionary. In those primitive
days the students were called together
by the blowing of a conch-shell. Though
quick and apt to learn, Ledyard hated
study. He preferred climbing the mountains
about the college. In four months
he ran away. He, however, returned,
but finding the rigid discipline no less
irksome than before, made his escape in
a canoe, in which he floated down the

<h4>
A YANKEE SHIP DISCOVERS THE COLUMBIA RIVER.
</h4>

<p>
With the close of the Revolutionary War, the commercial
spirit of our countrymen began to re-assert itself
in deeds which should stamp them for all time as worthy
sons of worthy sires. Far back, even when the colonies
were but a few feeble settlements strung along the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_157' name='Page_157' href='#Page_157'>157</a></span>
Atlantic seaboard, few people had shown greater enterprise
in seeking avenues for commerce than they.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<img src="images/i-168.jpg" width="400" height="488" alt="" />
<p class="caption">MOUTH OF THE COLUMBIA RIVER.</p>
</div>

<p>
This was especially the case with the New-England
colonies. War had ruined their commerce, but with the
coming of peace the shrewd New-England merchants
were on the lookout for new outlets, since nowhere
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_158' name='Page_158' href='#Page_158'>158</a></span>
could ships be so cheaply built, while the population
largely got their living either on or from the sea. Besides
this, they had a brand-new flag of their own, of
which they were justly proud, and which they wished
to see afloat on the most distant seas.
</p>

<p>
The discoveries made on the north-west coast by England,
though kept secret till after the close of the war,
were by no means unknown to our merchants and sailors,
in whom the laudable desire to profit by every
avenue the ocean might throw open to honest enterprise
and skill, was inspired and increased by a condition of
national freedom.
</p>

<p>
It was at this time that certain merchants of Boston
formed (1787) a partnership for beginning a trade between
the north-west coast and China. They fitted out
the ship "Columbia," of two hundred tons, and sloop
"Washington," of ninety tons burden, with trading-goods,
which the masters were to barter for furs with
the Indians, sell the furs at Canton, and with the proceeds
buy teas for the home-market. Large profits were
expected. As the United States was a new power at
sea, and her flag little known, the masters were provided
with passports, to certify they were honest traders
sailing under an honest flag.
</p>

<p>
The owners, however, looked somewhat farther than a
mere trading voyage would suggest. They had in mind
the establishment, under the national authority, of permanent
factories, somewhat similar to those of the
Hudson's Bay Company. Looking to this end, their
masters, John Kendrick and Robert Gray, were instructed
to buy lands of the natives, to build storehouses
or forts, or make such other improvements on these lands
as would insure their permanent tenure to the owners.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_159' name='Page_159' href='#Page_159'>159</a></span>
In so far as occupation by any white people was concerned,
the territory lying between Cape Mendocino
and the Straits of Fuca was known to be vacant, though,
out of England, Spain was thought to have the best
claim to it. Kendrick and Gray were therefore directed
to begin operations on this unexplored strip of coast,
not only as traders, but as explorers of an undiscovered
country.
</p>

<p>
Less could not well be said of these voyages, because
of the importance they subsequently assumed in the dispute
between England and
the United States about their
respective boundaries, but we
will leave that question now
to take its proper turn in the
story, and go back to the
voyages themselves.
</p>

<img src="images/i-170.jpg" width="150" height="151" alt="" />
<p class="caption">COIN STRUCK FOR THE VOYAGE.</p>
</div>

<p>
Both vessels<a name='FA_146' id='FA_146' href='#FN_146' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> reached
Nootka in the early autumn
of 1788. Having made her
cargo, the "Columbia" set
sail for Canton, sold her furs for teas, with which she
returned to Boston in August, 1790, thus first carrying
the flag quite round the world.
</p>

<p>
This time the Bostonians did not throw the tea overboard
as they had once done, when it came seasoned
with an odious tax. A quite different reception was
given to the "Columbia" as she sailed up the harbor
with the stars and stripes fluttering at her mast-head,
after an absence of nearly three years. As she passed
the Castle, the "Columbia" fired a national salute, which
the fortress immediately returned. The loud-booming
cannon brought the inhabitants in crowds to the wharves
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_160' name='Page_160' href='#Page_160'>160</a></span>
to see what ship was receiving such honorable welcome.
As the "Columbia" rounded to, in the inner harbor,
the people shouted, the cannon pealed, as if the occasion
were one worthy of public commemoration and rejoicing.
It was, indeed, felt to be the breaking away from old
despotisms which a colonial condition had so long imposed,
while the track round the globe was not yet so
much travelled, or so well known, as to make the "Columbia's"
voyage seem any less a great achievement.
</p>

<p>
It happened that the "Columbia" had touched at
Owyhee, the royal residence of the king of the Sandwich
Islands. Captain Gray persuaded the king to let
the crown prince go with him to the United States.
The prince was royally welcomed in Boston, and safely
returned to his native land, so bringing about a friendliness
between Americans and the islanders, of much
benefit to commerce in the future.
</p>

<p>
Although the owners had lost money<a name='FA_147' id='FA_147' href='#FN_147' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> by the venture,
they were public-spirited men, and determined on making
a second trial. The "Columbia" was therefore
again fitted for sea, and in June, 1791, was again breasting
the waves of the North Pacific. During this second
voyage, Captain Gray saw the mouth of a river, into
which, however, he did not sail, because the surf
broke with violence quite across it. He, however, carefully
noted down the latitude in his log; but when,
shortly after, he fell in with Vancouver, that officer
doubted what Gray told him about this river. It could
not be there, he thought, since he himself had carefully
searched without finding it.
</p>

<p>
After parting company with Vancouver, Gray sailed
south, with the intention of knowing more about the
river in question. When the entrance was sighted, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_161' name='Page_161' href='#Page_161'>161</a></span>
"Columbia" was boldly steered for it with all sails set.
She safely ran in between the breakers, into a broad
basin which no keel but hers had ever ploughed before,
and without anchoring held her onward course fourteen
miles up the river, surrounded by a swarm of canoes,
among which the stately ship moved a leviathan indeed.
</p>

<p>
When the anchor was let go, Captain Gray found
himself quietly floating on the bosom of a large freshwater
river, to which,
upon quitting it, he
gave the name of his
ship,—the Columbia.<a name='FA_148' id='FA_148' href='#FN_148' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a>

<p>
As a result of these
voyages, the direct
trade between the
North Pacific and
China fell almost exclusively
into the
hands of American
traders. British merchants
were restrained
from engaging
in it by the
opposition of their East India Company. Russian vessels
were not admitted into Chinese ports. We find
the British explorer, Mackenzie, speaking with much
ill-humor about this state of things, which, nevertheless,
only goes to prove the energy and skill of American
merchants and ship-masters, who, from the first voyages
of the "Columbia," were known to the Indians of the
north-west coast as Bostons, because these vessels hailed
from that port.

lying to the west of the Mississippi. The sources
of the Missouri<a name='FA_149' id='FA_149' href='#FN_149' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> were unknown even to French traders.
Nobody knew that a great sister river carried the snows
of the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific, or that the head
waters of these two noble streams lay coiled about the
feet of the same lofty chain.
</p>

<p>
Where, then, should we locate the West? Possibly
central along the eastern base of the Alleghanies, certainly
remote at Pittsburg, and perhaps reaching its
vanishing-point somewhere about the Dark and Bloody
Ground of Kentucky. Among a host of foes civilization
stood at bay here, but would take no backward
step.
</p>

<p>
France opened the way from east to west. France
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_163' name='Page_163' href='#Page_163'>163</a></span>
and England fought for the primacy of the continent,
and England won. Defeated France gave up the idea
of maintaining herself in America, and secretly ceded to
Spain what the war had left her west of the Mississippi,
as a bankrupt might convey his property out of the reach
of his most pressing creditor.
</p>

<p>
When the Colonies revolted, France saw her way to
make them, like the cat in the fable, pull her chestnuts
out of the fire. It is no part of a king's trade to set up
a republic. France played her own game,<a name='FA_150' id='FA_150' href='#FN_150' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> played it
astutely and to the end. When the Colonies, with her
help, achieved their independence, she showed them,
much to their wonder, for they were fresh to the tricks
of diplomacy, that in politics there is no more friendship
than in trade, or rather that politics is a game in
which the best player wins.
</p>

<p>
In view of what it had cost her to give up Louisiana,
in the first place, not only in loss of territory, but
national prestige, it is perhaps not strange that when,
as our ally, France was in turn a victor, she should be
found trying to get back Louisiana for herself. To do
this she had to play a double game, with the help of
Spain, while that power stood ready in the background
to take any thing that came in her way.
</p>

<p>
These two gamesters wished to restore what we should
call the old balance of power, thus confining the United
States nearly in the limits they had occupied as colonies.
To her honor, England would not listen to their
seductive pleadings. Not that she loved her revolted
subjects more, but that she loved her old rivals less.
When John Jay gave their schemes to the light of day,
it was seen France had never meant we should be a
power among the nations—only a little republic. In
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_164' name='Page_164' href='#Page_164'>164</a></span>
the end England's pride prevailed over the sting of
wounded self-love. Instead of dictating the terms of
peace, as she had meant to do, France had to see herself
shut out from Louisiana, for good and all, while
Spain, the Mephistophiles of American affairs, recovered
Florida from England, so excluding the United
States from access to the Gulf of Mexico either by the
seaboard or the Mississippi River. What was now left
of French Louisiana, as it existed previous to this war,
presented the anomaly of a colony of French people
living under the Spanish flag.
</p>

<p class="caption">A MISSISSIPPI FLAT-BOAT.</p>
</div>

<p>
In effect, John Jay had urged upon England that
blood is thicker than water. Franklin said, "Let us
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_165' name='Page_165' href='#Page_165'>165</a></span>
now forgive and forget." And so the Anglo-Saxon
spirit prevailed.
</p>

<p>
With independence achieved, the United States gained,
as we have seen, all the territory, except Canada, which
England had conquered from France. At a single
stride her frontier had reached the Mississippi on the
west and the Great Lakes on the north.
</p>

<p>
Before the war, of which this was the grand sequel,
a thin stream of English immigrants, chiefly from Virginia
and North Carolina, under the lead of Daniel
Boone, had crossed the mountains of North Carolina
into Kentucky. This movement was central in what
is commonly known as the Blue Grass Region, of which
Lexington may be considered the pivot.
</p>

<p>
After the war, a second and larger emigration, chiefly
from New England, crossed over the Alleghanies to the
head of navigation on the Ohio, whence it moved down
that river to the Muskingum, and was central about
Marietta. Here, then, we have two separate streams of
population, belonging to the same sturdy Anglo-Saxon
race, though originating in different sections of the
young Republic, each taking along with it to its new
home in the West the customs and traditions of its own
section, and guided by instinct or destiny upon lines
which, ere long, were to divide slave from free States.
</p>

<p>
By an Act of Congress, known in history as the Ordinance
of 1787, all that great block of wilderness country,
into which this last emigration was setting, became
one political division under the name of the North-west
Territory.<a name='FA_151' id='FA_151' href='#FN_151' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> The Act creating this territory also provided
for making three States from it, and most wisely
forbade that slavery should ever exist within its borders.
Thus it was that the Ohio came to be not only a physical,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_166' name='Page_166' href='#Page_166'>166</a></span>
but a political, dividing-line between the sections,
which, now that the law of the land had fixed a limit
slavery should not overstep, came to be designated as
North and South, not, as formerly, from geographical
situation only, but because the line had been thus
sharply drawn between free and slave institutions.
Each was now on trial before the world; each was now
to show what it could do for human progress, under its
own institutions, with its own means, and on its own
chosen ground.
</p>

<p>
It would seem as if this splendid acquisition of ours,
this North-west Territory, now constituting the great
heart and seat of power in the American Union, might
well have filled the fullest measure of patriotic desire
for territorial expansion. It was to be, however, but
the cradle of a newer and more robust growth, as the
original States had been for that just beginning at the
centre. It was an empire in itself, comprising all those
States now enclosed between the Mississippi, the Ohio,
Pennsylvania, and the Great Lakes. Yet this whole
tract held, in 1792, no more than ten thousand whites,
settled in widely scattered spots, among sixty-five thousand
wild Indians.
</p>

<p>
These widely scattered spots were the new settlements
at Marietta and Fort Harmar on the Muskingum,
Cincinnati and Fort Washington on the Ohio, Clarksville
at the Falls of the Ohio, with the old French posts
of Vincennes on the Wabash, Kaskaskia on the river of
the name, and Fort Chartres and Cahokia on the Mississippi.
Over this vast tract a score of military posts
held the Indians in check, and formed the kernels of
future settlements. Along the line of the Great Lakes,
and contrary to treaty stipulations with her, England
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_167' name='Page_167' href='#Page_167'>167</a></span>
still held the key-points,—Niagara, Miami, Detroit,
Michilimackinac,—thus restricting the movement of
our citizens from east to west on that line, and so shutting
them out from the lucrative Indian trade of the
Far West.
</p>

<p>
Let us now look at the section south of the Ohio.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">ON THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI.</p>
</div>

<p>
Kentucky was made a State in 1792, and Tennessee
in 1796. All south of Tennessee and west of Georgia
was formed (1798) into the Mississippi Territory. On
the east, or American, shore of the Mississippi, settlement
was mostly confined to the places mentioned in
"The Founding of Louisiana" as villages. None had
outgrown this condition. Most were simply plantations.
Population had increased (1785) to thirty-eight
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_168' name='Page_168' href='#Page_168'>168</a></span>
thousand persons, chiefly by the coming-in of refugees
from Nova Scotia and St. Domingo. And blacks were
already numerous enough to cause uneasiness among
the planters. The cultivation of cotton and sugar
was growing to importance; but the Spaniards at New
Orleans wanted all the water to their own mill, as the
proverb has it, which meant nearly the same thing as
closing the river to American trade altogether.
</p>

<p>
The Falls of the Ohio had already begun to assume
importance both as a depot and shipping-point. They
were a natural stopping-place for all boats going up or
down the river. Hence Louisville had grown up above
the falls as the port of a remarkably thrifty cluster of
inland settlements which had taken the place of the
primitive stations of the first settlers.
</p>

<p>
On both sides of the Ohio the Indians made a determined
stand against the coming in of white settlers. But
bravely as they fought, their power was so broken in
many bloody conflicts, that they were, at length (1794),
glad to sue for peace. Shorn of power, they were now
confined within narrower limits. England gave up
(1795) the lake fortresses. All roads to the West being
now open, they were speedily thronged by an army of
settlers.

ACQUISITION OF LOUISIANA.

<p class="center">
"<i>I have given England a rival that will humble her pride.</i>"—<i>Napoleon.</i>
</p>

<p>
We have now done with that part of French Louisiana
lying east of the Mississippi. It is now blossoming
all over with incipient civilization in the form
of log cabins, trading-posts, cross-roads, hamlets, and
schoolhouses.
</p>

<p>
From 1793 to 1799 our old ally France, now become
a republic, was trying first to cajole, then to bully us
into taking up her quarrel with England. She even
went to the length of demanding tribute-money from
us as the price of peace, and, upon a refusal, of ordering
our minister out of her territory. Our remonstrances
were treated with disdain, our ships captured, and our
flag fired upon at sea, without even the formality of a
declaration of war. This conduct drove us into making
reprisal. After one or two of her frigates had been
beaten in fight by ours, France grew more pacific toward
us, and again cultivated friendly relations with a power
she had seemed to despise, until the reply "Millions for
defence, but not a cent for tribute,"<a name='FA_152' id='FA_152' href='#FN_152' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> warned her that
America would never yield a principle to threats.
</p>

<p>
Let us now turn to Spain. In 1795 this power had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_172' name='Page_172' href='#Page_172'>172</a></span>
made a treaty which secured to us the right of storing<a name='FA_153' id='FA_153' href='#FN_153' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a>
American goods at New Orleans, pending shipment
abroad, thus making the river so far free for our commerce.
</p>

<p>
In 1800 Napoleon had come to the head of the French
nation. Ambition to restore the ancient sovereignty of
France over Louisiana led him to propose to Spain the
exchange of Tuscany for it. Spain accepted the offer,
and in 1800-1801 treaties of cession were signed, but
not made public, because war with England was probable,
and Napoleon wished to make his title good on the
spot with the bayonets of his soldiers, before England
could know of it. Therefore for the present Spain kept
possession of Louisiana in trust for France.
</p>

<p>
Just here some grave international questions arose.
Our rapid growth in the West gave Spain uneasiness.
It certainly was putting her possessions in peril. In
consequence she showed such an unfriendly spirit toward
us as to keep the West in a state of chronic irritation.<a name='FA_154' id='FA_154' href='#FN_154' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a>
It even disposed the West to listen to plans for separating
her from the East, which Spain would gladly have
aided in, and so was fast breaking up the feeling of
national unity so essential to keep alive in the Republic.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, without previous notice, the Spanish intendant
at New Orleans revoked the right of deposit.
The act shut the only door by which the people of
Ohio, Kentucky, and Illinois could get to the sea. It
exasperated them to such a point that they begged the
General Government to drive the Spaniards out of
the Mississippi for good and all.
</p>

<p>
In Thomas Jefferson the people of the West found a
more sagacious advocate. The cession could not long
remain a secret. It was soon known in the United
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_173' name='Page_173' href='#Page_173'>173</a></span>
States; but instead of calming the people, the change
of masters revived their fears, since it was felt that
Napoleon, whose exploits filled Europe with alarm,
would prove more difficult to deal with than Spain,
whom nobody feared.
</p>

<p>
Such was the situation presented to Mr. Jefferson.
Fortunately for its solution, national pride and national
policy do not always go hand in hand.
</p>

<p>
Our minister, Livingston,<a name='FA_155' id='FA_155' href='#FN_155' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> a very able man, was told
to bring the Louisiana question to Napoleon's attention,
and to do it in such a way as to leave no doubt in
his mind that the United States could not remain an
idle looker-on while New Orleans was being bought and
sold. She had too much at stake. Napoleon's army
was getting ready to sail for Louisiana. There was no
time to lose.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Livingston did not stop with the suggestion to sell
New Orleans to us. He went further, and proposed the
cession of all Louisiana above the Arkansas and east of
the Mississippi. He did it with true republican frankness,
never hesitating to press home upon Napoleon's
advisers the dilemma which the possession of Louisiana
must offer to their choice. "What will you do with
Louisiana? Would you have England wrest it from
you? Her navies have driven yours from the seas.
Do you wish to force the United States into joining
with England, against you? England would gladly
give us what we ask, as the price of our help."
</p>

<p>
France was on the eve of war with England. But
for this we should hardly have had Louisiana so easily.
There was no assurance felt that the fleet Napoleon
destined for Louisiana would ever reach the Balize.
Napoleon wanted money. It was true, national pride
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_174' name='Page_174' href='#Page_174'>174</a></span>
might be hurt by the sacrifice, but it was most important,
at this crisis, not to make an enemy of the United
States; and Napoleon foresaw that no foreign power
could long hold the mouth of the Mississippi, and have
peace with those States. That conviction was decisive
in its effects. He declared for the sale of Louisiana,
outright, in these words: "I will not keep a possession
which would not be safe in our hands, which would
embroil our people with the Americans, or produce a
coldness between us. I will make use of it, on the
contrary, to attach them to me, and embroil them with
the English, and raise up against the latter, enemies
who will some day avenge us."
</p>

<p>
Napoleon would not even wait for Mr. Monroe to
arrive, after making up his mind, but sent at once for
Mr. Livingston, and opened the matter with him on
the spot. So little had our ablest statesmen, Mr.
Livingston excepted, touched the root of the matter,
that, when Mr. Monroe did come, with powers from
Congress to treat for the cession of New Orleans and
the Floridas only, Napoleon surprised him with this
master-stroke of policy which not even Mr. Jefferson
had foreseen. And thus a treaty<a name='FA_156' id='FA_156' href='#FN_156' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> for the whole of
Louisiana was concluded on our part without adequate
powers.
</p>

<p>
The price agreed upon was eighty million francs, the
equivalent of twenty million dollars. Of this sum
sixty were to be paid in money. The remaining twenty
were to be retained by the United States as indemnity
for damage done to our commerce under the orders of
the Directory. In this way the nation became the
trustee for what is known as the French Spoliation
Fund. The principle was now laid down, that free
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_175' name='Page_175' href='#Page_175'>175</a></span>
ships make free goods. When they had signed the
treaty, the commissioners arose and shook each other's
hands. "We have lived long," said Livingston, "but
this is the noblest work of our lives." Mr. Jefferson's
efforts to bring about the geographical and political
unity of the United States were thus far completely
successful.

A GLANCE AT OUR PURCHASE.
</h4>

<p>
Hitherto Louisiana has played the part of a football
in European politics. The curtain is now to rise
upon a far different scene.
</p>

<p>
For fifteen millions the United States obtained more
territory than the original thirteen had started out
with.
</p>

<p>
As we have shown in a previous chapter, our people
had more than enough land already, and few men were
wise enough, in that day, to forecast our national greatness
in the future; but at last the Mississippi in all
its course was ours, and the one question of highest
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_176' name='Page_176' href='#Page_176'>176</a></span>
moment to the West was settled in our favor,—settled
definitely and forever.
</p>

<p>
With what actual materials for progress, in nation-building,
did the United States set up her rule over
Louisiana? The answer will show what the French and
Spaniards had done in two centuries or more of intermittent
effort.
</p>

<p>
Two rather large towns, twelve hundred miles apart,
held about one-third its whole population, and controlled
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_177' name='Page_177' href='#Page_177'>177</a></span>
all its trade. The first, New Orleans, was the commercial
port for the Mississippi Valley and its products.
The second, St. Louis, was a fur-trading post with its
chief outlet in Canada. One had a mixed population
of from eight thousand to ten thousand, Frenchmen,
Spaniards, Americans and blacks; the other did not
have more than twelve hundred people, all told, many
of whom were boatmen, who passed much of their
lives afloat on the rivers or domesticated among roving
tribes. In both, the French were most numerous, but
taking all Louisiana together, there were nearly, if
not quite, as many slaves as white people, although, as
compared with the Indians then occupying this vast
territory, the whites were only a handful.

<p class="caption">FRENCH SETTLEMENTS: GERM OF ST. LOUIS.</p>
</div>

<p>
At the date of cession to the United States, New
Orleans had perhaps fourteen hundred houses, mostly
built of wood and uniformly homely. Two hours would
have laid the whole of it in ashes. In the best part,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_178' name='Page_178' href='#Page_178'>178</a></span>
a few houses were built of brick, some one, some two
stories high, with the open galleries running round the
outside, one is accustomed to see in the tropics; yet
though it had been burned over so recently as 1794,
New Orleans was little bettered in the rebuilding, showing,
as before, a collection of hurriedly built barracks
and dwellings, among which the Hotel de Ville and
Parochial Church, alone, gave a certain metropolitan
character to this city of wood and shingles.
</p>

<p>
Though spacious, the streets were unpaved, dirty, and
ill-kept. No drainage could be had, and every thing
was thrown into the street. Summer heats quickly
developed epidemic fevers. It followed that New
Orleans had the name of being the most unhealthy city
in the United States.
</p>

<p>
Besides the church and Hotel de Ville, or City Hall,
there were a military hospital, charity hospital, and
nunnery,—all equally inconspicuous in point of architectural
design. There was also a theatre in which
a company, whom the revolt had driven from St.
Domingo, acted plays for the gratification of the Creole
population.
</p>

<p>
Going north, Natchitoches on Red River, and Arkansas
Post on the Arkansas, may be considered outposts
of the country immediately dependent upon New Orleans.
Each tapped the Indian trade of its river. The
first was a thriving, the second a poor village. We
next come upon a group of settlements, constituting
what was known, under French and Spanish rule, as
Upper Louisiana, with St. Louis for its emporium.
Chief among these were New Madrid,<a name='FA_157' id='FA_157' href='#FN_157' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> Cape Girardeau,
St. Genevieve, Carondelet, and St. Charles. The population,
all told, counting from the Arkansas to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_179' name='Page_179' href='#Page_179'>179</a></span>
Missouri, and including St. Louis, numbered about six
thousand, of whom at least a thousand were slaves,
with a sprinkling of half-breed French-Indian trappers
besides.
</p>

<p>
St. Louis had arisen out of the transfer of the east
bank of the Mississippi to Great Britain. Rather than
live as aliens, under English laws, many French settlers
went with Pierre Laclede,<a name='FA_158' id='FA_158' href='#FN_158' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> across the Mississippi, to a
place already nicknamed by them Pain Court, where,
in February, 1764, they founded a new town with the
name of St. Louis, in honor of Louis XV.

These people were mostly French Canadians,—either
traders, trappers, or voyageurs, who still kept up their
trading connection with Canada,—though a sprinkling
of Spaniards and Americans became incorporated with
them, so making St. Louis a city of many tongues like

New Orleans. In both, an American could fancy himself
in a foreign country, among foreigners. But while
New Orleans had grown up under the worst conditions,
in respect of situation and climate, St. Louis began her
career under the best of both. At New Orleans people
lived, as it were, on a floating island which the Mississippi
might deluge with her floods. St. Louis was laid
out on a spacious terrace, elevated above the united
floods of the Missouri and Mississippi. Besides its high
and healthy situation, the spot chosen by the founders
of St. Louis for their future city was the best one
to be found next south of the mouth of the Missouri
River. That the whole Indian trade of the upper country
was destined to be poured into the lap of the infant

metropolis, was early foreseen and soon realized by its
sagacious founders.

Of St. Louis in its infancy we lack adequate description.
It was a palisaded village of the pattern so often
described in these pages. During the Revolutionary
War (1780) it withstood the assault of a marauding
party sent against it from the Lakes, but lost some of its
inhabitants whom the enemy carried off into captivity.
At this time it
had one hundred
and twenty
houses with
eight hundred
inhabitants, who owned and bred many cattle. While
a few houses were of stone, the major part were mean,
and the streets narrow and dirty. With the cession
it began to grow apace.

When Father Charlevoix, the Jesuit historian of

found some miners at work on the Meramec, under
authority of Law's Company. While searching for

<p>
Mr. Jefferson had never forgotten his talk with
Ledyard at Paris. It was the key-note of future
projects. Even before Louisiana was ours, he began to
take steps for having it explored, partly with the view
of ascertaining its real value, but chiefly to determine
whether the Missouri and Columbia Rivers would afford
a practicable overland route for commerce with the
Pacific. Should they do so, the discovery of the century
would be made. It was the very first step taken to
open a road across the continent under national auspices,
and, as such, has historic importance, going far
beyond the aimless wanderings of a few migratory fur-traders,
who, thus far, were the sole geographers of this
interesting region.
</p>

<p>
Except that they took their rise somewhere in the
great Rocky Mountain chain, next to nothing was known
about the higher sources of the Missouri. Something,
indeed, was learned from the French traders who had
been making canoe voyages up the Missouri for many
years. These adventurers had pushed their way into
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_185' name='Page_185' href='#Page_185'>185</a></span>
the Osage, the Kansas, and the Platte. To them we
owe the names these streams bear to-day, which are
derived, the Platte<a name='FA_160' id='FA_160' href='#FN_160' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> alone excepted, from the tribes inhabiting
their banks. For the same reason the great
Missouri<a name='FA_161' id='FA_161' href='#FN_161' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> itself was given this name by the French
explorers because they were ignorant of its existing
Indian name.
</p>

<p>
From their known activity and restlessness of character,
we should expect to find evidences of the presence
of Frenchmen everywhere in a region
they had possessed for centuries.
We do find that the most adventurous
had ascended not only as high
as the Yellowstone,<a name='FA_162' id='FA_162' href='#FN_162' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> but had
even found their way into the
Black Hills, so establishing
an important landmark for
after-comers. Indeed, both
the Yellowstone and the
Black Hills owe their names
to these pioneers.

</div>

<p>
But the knowledge thus
gained was, at best, little better than what would be
disclosed by the mirage of the prairies themselves. It
was vague, mostly inaccurate, and often quite upside
down.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, while an occasional trapper or trader
might be met with on the Missouri, no habitation of
civilized man existed in all its magnificent valley, if we
except the French settlements begun near its mouth.
This state of things is all the more striking because it
comes within the memory of living men.
</p>

<p>
Beyond their regular villages, which could be moved
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_186' name='Page_186' href='#Page_186'>186</a></span>
at a few hours' warning, the Indians of this valley had
no fixed habitations, but roamed the wide, treeless
prairies in savage freedom, like wandering Arabs of the
desert, carrying their skin-tents on the backs of their
shaggy little ponies about with them from camp to
camp.
</p>

<p>
These rovers of the prairies had the same barbaric
picturesqueness, the same wild and free manners, the
same thieving propensities, as the Arab. Like him,
the Indian of the plains set the greatest value on his
horse, which,
though subdued
to his rider's
will, was yet as
untamed as he.
</p>

<p class="caption">INDIANS MOVING CAMP.</p>
</div>

<p>
Once a year
the whole village
struck its
tents, and started
off on its annual
buffalo-hunt.
On the eve of departure, a solemn dance was
held and offerings made to the god of the chase, without
whose help they believed the hunt would be in
vain. Their hunting camps were pitched at some favorite
spot, where grass grew and water could be had.
Here they lived in savage luxury on the buffalo-meat
which the hunters brought in from the chase. When
enough meat had been obtained for their winter's supply,
they rode back to their villages, and with singing
and dancing celebrated the success of the hunt. Thus
they hunted, ate, slept, and waged continual war with
each other. This was all their life.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_187' name='Page_187' href='#Page_187'>187</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Of the Columbia<a name='FA_163' id='FA_163' href='#FN_163' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> nothing certain was known. More
was known, even in America, about the Nile. It was
thought, however, that its highest streams would be
found interlocked with those of the Missouri, about the
feet of the same great mountain chain. Should this
prove true, a practicable passage from one to the other
through these mountains might be discovered; yet while
nothing actual was known about them the difficulties
were felt to be so uncommon, that none but men of
tried courage would be found equal to them. Clearly
it was to be no holiday journey. Just what obstacles
lay in the explorer's way, what means of living the
country would afford, what sort of people would be
met with, were questions no one had so far attempted
to solve.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Jefferson set about solving them. He looked
about him for the man to do the work. His first choice
fell upon his own secretary, Captain Meriwether Lewis,<a name='FA_164' id='FA_164' href='#FN_164' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a>
"of courage undaunted," at whose request Captain
William Clarke<a name='FA_165' id='FA_165' href='#FN_165' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a> was invited to make one of the party.
Clarke accepted the offer with great glee. Both were
young men, both had seen service on the frontiers, both
were Virginians, and both gave heart and soul to the
enterprise in hand.
</p>

<p>
Though its objects were less scientific than political,
the young explorers were commanded to carefully note
down every thing of interest about the countries and
nations they were going to pass through—what were
the natural products of the one, or the numbers, disposition
and manners of the other.
</p>

<p>
It was to be a long voyage to begin with—two
thousand miles at the least. The best the Government
could do was to provide a keel-boat, fifty-five feet long,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_188' name='Page_188' href='#Page_188'>188</a></span>
drawing three feet, carrying one large square sail and
twenty-two oars. A half deck at bow and stern
formed forecastle and cabin, the middle being left open
for the rowers. This vessel, we see, was but a modification
of the galley of ancient times, and quite like those
used by the Spaniards in exploring our coasts two
centuries before.
</p>

<p>
Thus equipped the party started down the Ohio on
their long journey to the Pacific.
</p>

<p>
The Spaniards had not
yet given up St. Louis to
us when the expedition
reached there, in the
autumn of 1803. It therefore
went into winter quarters
on the American bank
of the Mississippi, opposite
the mouth of the Missouri.
</p>

<p class="caption">A MANDAN.</p>
</div>

<p>
It was the middle of
May before the voyage up
the Missouri could begin.
With sail and oars, the
deeply laden keel-boat was
forced slowly along against
a swift yellow tide, which ever and anon hurled floating
trees athwart its course, or brought it to a standstill on
some hidden sand-bar. Compared with it, the navigation
of the Ohio was but a pleasure-trip. The Platte,
however, was reached late in July. Not far above, the
explorers landed to hold a council with the Otoes, for
which reason they gave the place the name of Council
Bluff.
</p>

<p>
In the last days of October, 1804, they halted for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_189' name='Page_189' href='#Page_189'>189</a></span>
the winter at the Mandan villages, sixteen hundred
miles from the Mississippi. So far the journey had
been only fatiguing. Its real difficulties were just
beginning.
</p>

<p>
The winter was spent in making ready for the coming
season's work, in hunting and exploring, and in talks
with the Indians, from whom it was now learned that
after many days' journey toward the setting sun, the
white men would come to a gorge wondrous deep and
wild, where the whole river plunged foaming down
with thunderous roar. They even spoke with veneration
of the solitary eagle which had built her nest in a
dead cottonwood tree, among the mists of the cataract
itself.
</p>

<p>
With the early spring (1805) the party again set
out in good health and spirits. Before doing so Captain
Lewis sent back all but the bravest and strongest men,
as he was now about to enter a region roamed over
by predatory savages, whose friendship would be best
secured by being always ready to fight them, for
though brave, they would seldom attack a well-armed
party of whites unless the advantage was on their own
side.
</p>

<p>
As they went on, each day found the navigation of
the river growing more and more difficult. Sometimes
they were forced to drag their canoes slowly along with
the aid of towlines, or again to push them over shallow
places or through dangerous rapids with poles. Their
hunters kept them supplied with venison, bear and
buffalo meat, which they were now mostly to live on
for months to come.
</p>

<p>
The Yellowstone was reached and passed. On the
26th of May the party came in sight of the Rocky
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_190' name='Page_190' href='#Page_190'>190</a></span>
Mountains,—a long line of snowy summits nestling
among clouds. By the end of the month they were
skirting the Black Hills, or <i>Côte Noire</i> of the French
traders. The river grew swifter now, and its bed
thickly sown with rocks. Since leaving the Mandan
villages no permanent habitations had been seen,
though the travellers often came upon traces of some
transient encampment where the ground would be
strewed with the remnants of savage feasts. While
the men were wearily dragging the boats on at a snail's
pace through the river shallows, Captains Lewis and
Clarke would be scouting the country in advance, rifle
in hand. Whenever a bluff was climbed to gain a wider
view, thousands upon thousands of buffaloes would be
seen quietly feeding on the prairies, far as the eye could
reach. Then at the evening halt, round the camp-fires,
the events of the day would be noted down, its difficulties
talked over, and the chances for the morrow
discussed, over the joints of venison or bear-meat the
hunters had brought in. At dark sentinels were posted.
Relaxation gave way to discipline. Fresh logs were
thrown on the blazing fires. The men stretched themselves
on the ground in their blankets, and soon forgot
the fatigues of the day. At dawn the camp was again
astir.

<h4>
THEY CROSS THE CONTINENT.
</h4>

<p>
On the 13th of June, while scouting in advance of
his party, Captain Lewis saw, in the distance, a thin
cloudlike mist rising up out of the plain. To him it
was like the guiding column which led the Israelites
in the desert. Not doubting that it was the Great Fall,
which the Mandans had told him about, and of which
he was in search, Captain Lewis hastened toward it.
He soon heard it roar distinctly, and in a few hours
more stood on the brink of the cataract itself. The
Indians had told him truly. Not even the eagle's nest
was wanting to make their description complete.
</p>

<p>
He was the first white man who had ever stood there,
and he calls it a sublime sight.
</p>

<p>
Thirteen miles of cascades and rapids! At headlong
speed the Missouri rushes down a rocky gorge, through
which it has torn its way, now leaping over a precipice,
now lost to sight in the depths of the cañon,<a name='FA_166' id='FA_166' href='#FN_166' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> a thousand
feet below the plain, or again, as with recovered breath,
breaking away from these dark gulfs into the light of
clay and bounding on again. No wonder the discoverer
stood forgetful of all else but this wondrous work of
nature!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_192' name='Page_192' href='#Page_192'>192</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Much valuable time was lost in getting the boats and
baggage round these falls. To pass them was impossible.
It was necessary to build carriages on which the
boats were dragged by hand a distance of eighteen
miles, before they could be launched again.
</p>

<p>
But after all this had been done the boats were found
unsuited to the navigation of the river above them, and
so new ones had to be hewed out of the trees growing on
the banks, which could better withstand the buffeting
of the rocks. In these the party again embarked, and
on the 19th of July found themselves just entering a
deep gorge of the mountains, five miles long, through
which the river wound its way between walls of rock
that rose a thousand feet above their heads. They
named this awful cañon the Gate of the Rocky Mountains.
</p>

<p>
Boat navigation was now nearly at an end. Every
day the scouts were sent out in search of roving Indians
from whom they might get horses and guides to cross
the mountains. But no Indians could be found. A
well-beaten trail had been followed high up into the
hills, but lost again among defiles so narrow and stony,
that when the scouts came back they said no horseman
could go through them. So these great mountains,
which so long had been to them a guide and landmark,
now seemed sternly forbidding their farther progress.
</p>

<p>
Yet at all risks horses and guides must be had. Telling
his men he would not come back till he had found
them, Captain Lewis set out on his forlorn search, knowing
that on him depended the success or failure of the
expedition. The men remained encamped where he
left them.<a name='FA_167' id='FA_167' href='#FN_167' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a>
</p>

<p>
While engaged in this search, Captain Lewis, on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_193' name='Page_193' href='#Page_193'>193</a></span>
12th of August, reached the highest source of the Missouri.
At three thousand miles from its mouth it dwindled
to a mountain brook. Passing thence over the
dividing ridge, he came upon the waters of what proved
to be the Columbia. So within a few hours he drank
of the waters of both. Following the stream down the
mountain, with fresh hope, it led him to a village of
the Shoshones or Snake Indians.<a name='FA_168' id='FA_168' href='#FN_168' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a>
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_194' name='Page_194' href='#Page_194'>194</a></span>
</p>

<p>
No shipwrecked wanderer on an unknown sea ever
looked with more eagerness on a rescuing sail than
Lewis did upon this uncouth and squalid habitation
in the wilderness. The Indians would not believe he
had crossed the mountains on foot and without guides.
At length, however, some of them agreed to go back
with him, and these having found his story true, horses
and guides were furnished for the white men's use.
</p>

<p>
Thus equipped, the party began the passage of the
mountains, following the obscure windings of a trail
known only to the Indians themselves. They found it
a hard march. Sometimes it led them through a wild
cañon strewed with stones for miles together. Sometimes
the caravan would be painfully climbing some
slippery height, or skirting the edge of a precipice where
a single false step would have flung horse and rider
headlong to the bottom of the ravine.
</p>

<p>
But these active little horses, which the Indians rode
without saddle or bridle, unshod and ill-fed as they
were, did their work to the admiration of the white men.
Though they frequently slipped and fell with their burdens,
they would quickly scramble to their feet again
with the agility of mountain goats.
</p>

<p>
Almost a month was thus spent in getting through
the mountains. Snow fell, and water froze among those
rocky heights. On some days five miles would be the
most they could advance. On others they could
scarcely go forward at all. The plenty they had enjoyed
in the plains gave way to scarcity or worse. Seldom
could the hunters bring in any thing but a pheasant, a
squirrel, or a hawk, to men famishing with hunger and
worn down by a hard day's tramp. The daily food
mostly consisted of berries and dried fish, of which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_195' name='Page_195' href='#Page_195'>195</a></span>
every man got a mouthful, but none a full meal. When
a horse gave out he was killed and eaten with avidity.
The men grew sick and dispirited under incessant labor
for which want of nourishing food rendered them every
day more and more incapable. In short, every suffering
which cold, hunger, and fatigue could bring, was borne
by these explorers.
</p>

<p>
Ragged, half-starved, and foot-sore, but upheld by
the courage of their leaders, the explorers came out
on the other side of the mountains less like conquerors
than fugitives.
</p>

<p>
Their guides led them on, past many streams, till
they came to one on which they were told they might
safely embark. It was the Kooskooskee. This was
about four hundred miles from the place where they had
left their boats on the other side of the mountains.
They had struck one of the southern affluents of the
Columbia.
</p>

<p>
Here the party built canoes in which they began to
descend the river, leaving their horses with the Nez
Percés Indians<a name='FA_169' id='FA_169' href='#FN_169' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> to keep against their return. In three
days this stream led into a larger one to which they
gave the name of Lewis River. In seven, they reached
the junction of a larger branch coming from the north,
which they named the Clarke. They were now fairly
afloat upon the great river itself. Down this they paddled
till they came to the point where the Columbia in
a series of mad leaps breaks through the lofty Cascade
chain.<a name='FA_170' id='FA_170' href='#FN_170' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> These too were safely passed.
</p>

<p>
It was now late in October. All along the explorers
had found camps pitched on the borders of the rivers,
for the Indians of this region lived wholly on salmon,
like the tribes Mackenzie had fallen in with on Frazer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_196' name='Page_196' href='#Page_196'>196</a></span>
River. Wherever the river was broken by rapids a
noted fishing-place would be found, so the travellers
were now in a land of plenty; but the farther they fell
down, the more squalid the Indians became, and of
meaner looks and stature. Had these people shown
themselves unfriendly, Lewis and Clarke might never
have reached the ocean, for the valley was everywhere
very populous.
</p>

<p class="caption">CATCHING SALMON, COLUMBIA RIVER.</p>
</div>

<p>
Since leaving the cascades, evidences of approach to
the sea multiplied. Up to that point no fire-arms had
been seen among the Indians. Many now had guns, and
showed themselves more and more presuming toward
the white men. They traversed the river in great war
canoes, having images set up at the stem and stern, like
the vikings of old. But our men did not fear them.
They were already more than half Indians themselves
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_197' name='Page_197' href='#Page_197'>197</a></span>
in dress, looks and habits of life. They had learned
to eat dog-meat, and to make their beds wherever the
night found them.
</p>

<p>
Soon the tides were observed. On the 7th of November
the roar of the breakers was heard in the distance.
They had reached their goal at last.
</p>

<p>
A most inhospitable welcome awaited the explorers.
They had struck the coast in the rainy season. The
floods drove them from their first camp on the north
side, to the south side of the river, where they set to
work building themselves winter quarters. The little
clump of cabins was named Fort Clatsop, from the tribe
on whose land it stood, with the flag the explorers had
brought waving over it. Here the winter was passed.
</p>

<p>
In March, 1806, the explorers began their journey
home. At the Falls of the Columbia they bought horses
which took them to the place where their own had been
left. From here they travelled on an east line through
the mountains till the head of Clarke's River was struck.
The party was then divided. One band under Lewis
crossed the mountains to the head-waters of the Maria
River, while the other, under the lead of Clarke, passed
them lower down, so reaching the sources of the Yellowstone,
down which they floated to the place of rendezvous.

<h4>
PIKE EXPLORES THE ARKANSAS VALLEY.
<br />
<span class="s08"><i>PIKE'S PEAK A LANDMARK</i>.</span>
</h4>

<p>
In the course of an expedition made to the Upper
Mississippi, in the years 1805 and 1806, Lieutenant
Zebulon M. Pike<a name='FA_171' id='FA_171' href='#FN_171' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> had shown such aptitude for the
work of an explorer, that he was immediately chosen
to lead another to the sources of the Arkansas. Pike
was directed to go through the country of the Osages,
with whom the Kansas nation was then at war, and,
after effecting a peace between them, "to ascertain the
direction, extent, and navigation of the Arkansas and
Red Rivers."
</p>

<p>
In pursuance of these orders Pike left St. Louis in
July, 1806, for the Osage villages, in row-boats which
made about fifteen miles a day, his men living on the
bears, deer, and turkeys killed along the banks. Turning
into the Osage River, the Indian villages were
reached about the middle of August, and Pike here
began mounting his party for the long land journey
before him.
</p>

<p>
Having accomplished this, the party set out for the
Pawnee villages on the Platte. Near the Grand Osage
Village, Peter Chouteau,<a name='FA_172' id='FA_172' href='#FN_172' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> a French trader, had a trading-house,
which was the last sign of civilization the
explorers would see until the Spanish settlements of
New Mexico were reached.
</p>

<p>
Tents were struck Sept. 1. The exploring party
rode away in high spirits, accompanied by a numerous
train of warriors who, in this way, did honor to those
whom they considered their guests.
</p>

<p class="caption">MAP ILLUSTRATING LIEUTENANT PIKE'S EXPLORATIONS.</p>
</div>

<p>
After following the Osage for some distance Pike
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_199' name='Page_199' href='#Page_199'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_200' name='Page_200' href='#Page_200'>200</a></span>
struck across the country to the Neosho, a tributary of
the Arkansas. As he rode on across the dividing ridge
the prairies of Kansas broke on his sight like a scene of
enchantment. He seemed discovering a corner of paradise
itself.
</p>

<p>
From the Neosho, Pike passed over to the Smoky
Hill Fork of the Kansas, and thence to the Republican,
meaning to proffer friendship to the Pawnees, whose
evil reputation, however,
boded no good
to his mission.
</p>

<div class="figleft">

<img src="images/i-211.jpg" width="220" height="251" alt="" />
<p class="caption">INDIAN BURIAL-PLACE.</p>
</div>

<p>
When he came to
their villages the
Pawnees had just
been visited by an
embassy sent from
New Mexico to sow
distrust, if not enmity,
toward the Americans.
The Spaniards
had come with three
hundred men, by the
side of whom Pike's
twenty-three looked
small indeed, and to the Pawnees indicated the number
of warriors each nation had at its command. They
were therefore at no pains to hide their disdain.
</p>

<p>
Pike found them in this temper. Knowing it would
never do to show fear, he hoisted his flag in the chief
town to let them see that sour looks and uncivil words
could not turn him from his purpose of making them
show respect for the government of the United States,
even if they felt a preference for the Spaniards.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_201' name='Page_201' href='#Page_201'>201</a></span>
</p>

<p>
His mission in this quarter having failed, Pike turned
back to the Arkansas, which was reached on the 18th
of October. At this point Lieutenant Wilkinson was
sent down the river, while Pike himself began the
work of tracing it to its source. When he had done
this, Pike meant to cross over to the head of Red
River and then descend it to Natchitoches, so completing
the work laid out for him, which, we have seen,
was partly diplomatic and partly geographical in its
nature; for the government wished to have the natives
not only keep peace toward us, but among themselves.
So we at least set out in our new purchase with a
sound Indian policy.
</p>

<p>
Thus Pike's explorations would take in all the great
central region lying between the waters of the Red and
Platte Rivers and the Rocky Mountains, which to-day
is perhaps the most fertile and populous of all the
Great West.
</p>

<p>
But Pike's plans were doomed to meet failure, and
he himself to sufferings which a man of weaker mould
would have sunk under. As it was, they served to
bring out those splendid qualities which raised him
to the rank of general at the age of thirty-three, and
made his name renowned in our military annals.
</p>

<p>
On the 15th of November he came in sight of the
lofty Spanish Peaks. Soon the diminishing river he
was following buried itself among the hills, where
it was lost to view. Thinking thus to get a better
idea of the country round him, Pike set out on a
prospecting tour, in the course of which he climbed
the elevated peak now so fitly bearing his own name,
and saw the matchless view outspread from its summit.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_202' name='Page_202' href='#Page_202'>202</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Winter had now set in. Day by day difficulties
multiplied. The streams were frozen up or buried in
snow-drifts, so that it was next to impossible to follow
them into the ravines which gave them birth. Where
to look for the sources of Red River, Pike knew not.
Decoyed among the hills, till all bearings were lost,
his search for it was in vain. Beaten back, but not
dismayed, he then spent days in trying to recover the
trail made by the Spaniards in going from Santa Fé to
the Platte. It was
obliterated by frost
and snow. Baffled
everywhere, his
party wandered to
and fro like lost
men, often without
food or shelter, but
directed and encouraged
to new
efforts by their unconquerable
leader.
</p>

<div class="figleft">

<img src="images/i-213.jpg" width="220" height="195" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PIKE'S PEAK.</p>
</div>

<p>
At last, when
nearly spent, the
party reached the banks of a stream which Pike believed
to be the one he was in search of. One can
hardly realize to-day this desperate struggle for life
as taking place among the pleasure-grounds of Colorado.
</p>

<p>
Men and animals being broken down with fatigue,
and all in danger of perishing for want of the necessaries
of life, Pike resolved to send to Santa Fé for the
help without which he could not stir from the place
where he then was. Dr. Robinson offered himself to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_203' name='Page_203' href='#Page_203'>203</a></span>
go on this errand. He was one of the strongest men
of the party, and second only to Pike as a hunter.
The hopes of the explorers went with him. When he
had gone, all who could still work were set to building
a block-house, for shelter or defence.
</p>

<p>
One day while Pike was out hunting, two strangers
rode up to him. They had come from Santa Fé.
Robinson had safely arrived, and would soon be heard
from. Feeling no mistrust of them, Pike took these
strangers back to his camp. To his surprise he then
learned that he was but two days' journey from
Santa Fé.
</p>

<p>
These visitors had not been gone many days when a
squadron of Spanish horse rode up to the block-house.
The officer in command then notified Pike that he was
encamped on the Rio Grande, on Spanish ground. It
was now clear that the first visitors were sent to spy
out Pike's place of retreat, while this force followed on
to take the Americans prisoners. It also came to light
that they were suspected of having a design to seize
the province<a name='FA_173' id='FA_173' href='#FN_173' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> of New Mexico.
</p>

<p>
Pike went to Santa Fé to explain why he was
found trespassing on Spanish territory, but was held
as a prisoner with his men, whose appearance, as he
describes it, is the best proof of the hardships they
had undergone while lost in the mountains. He
says,—
</p>

<p>
"When we presented ourselves at Santa Fé, I was
dressed in a pair of blue trousers, moccasins, blanket-coat,
and a cap made of scarlet cloth lined with fox-skins,
and my poor fellows in leggings, breech-cloths,
and leather coats. There was not a hat in the whole
party. Our appearance was extremely mortifying to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_204' name='Page_204' href='#Page_204'>204</a></span>
us all, especially as soldiers; and although some of the
officers would frequently say to me, that 'Worth made
the man,' yet the first impression made on the ignorant
is hard to eradicate; and greater proof cannot be
given of the ignorance of the common people here
than their asking if we lived in houses, or camps like
the Indians, or if we wore hats in our country."
</p>

<p>
After a brief detention, the explorers were sent back
to the United States, under armed escort, by way of
El Paso, San Antonio and Natchitoches. Pike's papers
were taken from him, so depriving the world of the
interesting details which at that time were eagerly
sought for, but now had to be supplied largely from
memory.
</p>

<p>
At the same time that Pike was engaged in these
explorations, parties were sent up the Red and Washita
Rivers, with the view of enlarging the scope of his
undertaking.<a name='FA_174' id='FA_174' href='#FN_174' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a>

<h4>
NEW MEXICO IN 1807.
</h4>

<p>
Although, in its main objects, Pike's expedition seems
unfruitful of results, we owe to his capture an interesting
account of New Mexico, as he saw it at that time.
</p>

<p>
"The village of the Warm Springs or Aqua Caliente,"
he tells us, "at a distance presents to the eye a square
enclosure of mud walls,
the houses forming the
wall. They are flat on
top, or with very little
ascent on one side,
where spouts carry off
the water of the melting
snow and rain,
when it falls, which,
we were told, had been
but once in two years.
</p>

<div class="figright">

<img src="images/i-216.jpg" width="220" height="306" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE YUCCA-TREE: SPANISH BAYONET.</p>
</div>

<p>
"The houses were
all of one story, the
doors narrow, the windows
small, and in one
or two houses there
were talc lights. This
village had a mill near
it, situated on the little
creek of the same name, which made very good
flour. The population consisted of perhaps five hundred
Indians, civilized, but of much mixed blood.
</p>

<p>
"Here we had a dance which is called the fandango,
but there was one other, which was copied from the
Mexicans, and is now danced in the first societies of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_206' name='Page_206' href='#Page_206'>206</a></span>
New Spain, and has even been introduced at the court
of Madrid.
</p>

<p>
"The greatest natural curiosity is the warm springs,
of which there are two, each affording sufficient water
for a mill-seat. They appeared to be impregnated with
copper, and were more than 33° above blood-heat.
From this village, the Indians drove off two thousand
horses at one time, when at war with the Spaniards.
</p>

<p>
"St. John's (San Juan) was also enclosed by a mud
wall, and probably contained one thousand souls; its
population also chiefly consisted of civilized Indians, as
indeed do all the villages of New Mexico, the whites not
forming the one-twentieth part of the inhabitants.
</p>

<p>
"The house-tops of this village, as well as the streets,
were crowded when we entered it. At the door of the
public quarters, we were met by the priest. When the
officer in charge of my escort dismounted, and embraced
him, all the poor creatures who stood around strove to
kiss the ring or hand of the holy father. My men were
taken to the quarters provided for them, and I went to
the priest's, who offered me coffee, chocolate, or whatever
else he had, and bid me consider myself at home in
his house.
</p>

<p>
"Santa Fé, the capital, is situated along the banks of a
small creek, which comes down from the mountains, and
runs west to the Rio del Norte. Although it is but three
streets in width, it is about a mile long. Seen from a
distance, I was struck with the resemblance to a fleet of
flat-boats floating down the Ohio in the spring. There
are two churches, whose fine steeples form a striking contrast
to the squalid appearance of the houses around them.
</p>

<p>
"In the centre is the public square, or plaza, one side
of which forms the flank of the soldiers' square, which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_207' name='Page_207' href='#Page_207'>207</a></span>
is closed and in some degree defended by round towers
in the angles, which flank the four curtains: another
side of the square is formed by the palace of the governor,
his guard-houses, etc. The third side is occupied
by the priests and their suite, and the fourth by the Chapetones
who reside in the city. The houses are generally
only one story high, with flat roofs, and have a very
mean appearance on the outside, though some are richly
furnished, especially with plate. The supposed population
is four thousand five hundred souls. On our entering
the town, the crowd was very great, and followed
us to the government house. When we dismounted,
we were taken through various rooms, the floors of
which were covered with buffalo-robes, bear-skins, or
those of other animals, to a chamber where we waited
for some time, until his excellency appeared."

</div>

<p>
In going down the valley into Texas, Pike gained
some insight into the traffic carried on between Old and
New Mexico, and of its regulated movements.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_208' name='Page_208' href='#Page_208'>208</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"We passed the encampment," he continues, "of the
caravan, going out with about fifteen thousand sheep
for the other provinces, from which they bring back
merchandise. This expedition consisted of about three
hundred men, chiefly citizens, who were escorted by an
officer and forty soldiers. They come together at Ciboletta
in February, and separate there on their return in
March. A similar expedition goes out in the autumn.
At other times of the year no citizen travels over the
road, the couriers alone excepted. At the pass of the
Rio del Norte, the couriers meet and exchange packets,
when each returns to his own province. We met a
caravan of fifty men and probably two hundred horses,
loaded with goods for New Mexico.
</p>

<p>
"Saturday morning, March 21, we arrived at the Paso
del Norte, through a mountainous country. We put up
at the house of Don Francisco Garcia, who is a wealthy
merchant, and planter. He had, in the neighborhood,
twenty thousand sheep and one thousand cows. We
were received in a most hospitable manner, by Don
Pedro Roderique Rey, the lieutenant-governor, and
Father Joseph Prado, the vicar of the place. This was
by far the most flourishing town we had so far been in."

<div class="chapter">
<h4>
GOLD IN COLORADO.
<br />
<span class="s08">
<i>A Trapper's Story.</i>
</span>
</h4>

<p>
Pike found but one American living in Santa Fé.
This man had been a trapper, accustomed to the wild
and free life of the plains, and this was the story he
told.
</p>

<p>
James Pursley was a Kentuckian who had gone in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_209' name='Page_209' href='#Page_209'>209</a></span>
1799 to St. Louis, lured by the thirst for adventure for
which men of his class willingly give up all the comforts
of civilized life. He was one of those men who,
like Daniel Boone,<a name='FA_175' id='FA_175' href='#FN_175' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> thought it time to move on when
he could no longer fell a tree so that its top would lie
within a few yards of the door of his cabin.
</p>

<p>
So in advance of the explorer comes the trapper of
the West, who, while flying from civilization, is actually
paving the way for its coming in spite of himself.
</p>

<p>
In 1802, with two companions, Pursley left St. Louis,
and travelled west to the head of the Osage, where
they made a successful hunt. From thence the trappers
started for the White River of Arkansas, meaning to
go down to New Orleans with their peltries, but while
getting ready for the long voyage the Indians stole
their horses from them.
</p>

<p>
The hunters pursued the robbers to their villages.
The horses were there, but the Indians would not
give them up. Seeing an Indian riding on his horse,
Pursley ran up to him, and with his hunting knife
ripped open the horse's bowels. The incensed savage
instantly ran to his lodge for his gun. It missed fire.
Pursley then sprang upon him with his drawn knife in
his hand. The Indian took refuge in a lodge filled
with children and squaws. The chiefs were so struck
with the bravery of the "mad Americans," as they
called them, that they gave them back their horses
again.
</p>

<p>
Pursley and his comrades then returned to the place
where they had hid their peltry, meaning to go to St.
Louis by land, but when they were near the Osage,
their horses were again stolen. Hewing themselves a
canoe out of a log, they paddled down the Osage without
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_210' name='Page_210' href='#Page_210'>210</a></span>
further misadventure till they came to its mouth,
when the canoe overset, and the whole year's hunt was
lost. They, however, managed to save their powder and
guns.
</p>

<p>
In the Missouri they met a French trader going up to
the Mandan country. Pursley at once engaged to go
with him for the voyage.
</p>

<p>
On reaching their destination, Pursley was sent out
on a hunting and trading trip with some friendly Paducas
and Kiowas, they taking with them a few trading
goods. In the ensuing spring, while hunting at the
sources of the Platte, they were driven into the neighboring
mountains by hostile Sioux. Pursley estimated
their number at two thousand, with ten thousand animals.
Well was this nation called the Scourge of the
Great Plains!
</p>

<p>
Knowing themselves to be on the borders of New
Mexico, it was decided that Pursley, with a few others,
should go to Santa Fé in order to learn if the Spaniards
would give them good treatment if they came there to
trade.
</p>

<p>
The Spanish governor having promised them good
treatment, the Indian deputies went back to their
bands, but rather than again risk capture by the cruel
Sioux, Pursley thought best to stay where he was,
among a civilized people. He arrived at Santa Fé in
June, 1805, and had been following the carpenter's
trade ever since. Lieutenant Pike describes him as a
man of strong natural sense, of dauntless courage, and
the first American who had penetrated so far into the
wilds of Louisiana.
</p>

<p>
Among other things, Pursley told Lieutenant Pike
"that he had found gold on the head waters of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_211' name='Page_211' href='#Page_211'>211</a></span>
Platte, and had carried some of the virgin ore about
with him in his shot-pouch for months; but being in
doubt whether he should ever again behold the civilized
world, and having wholly discarded all the ideal
value with which mankind has stamped that metal, he
threw the sample away; that he had imprudently mentioned
it to the Spaniards, who had frequently importuned
him to go and show them the place, though,
conceiving it to lie in our territory, he had always refused,
and was fearful that his doing so might prove an
obstacle to his leaving the country."
</p>

<p>
This man little dreamed that after lying dormant half
a century, the discovery of which he thought so little
would one day be the making of a great State.

<h4>
THE FLAG IN OREGON.
</h4>

<p>
We have seen that Mr. Jefferson's plan for securing
the commerce of the Great West needed two things for
its success. One was a road across the continent. This
had been found. The other want was a port on the
Pacific. When this had been met, not only would the
resources of Louisiana lie open to East and West, but
the way to India be found, and the unity of America
secured for all time.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_212' name='Page_212' href='#Page_212'>212</a></span>
</p>

<p>
As emigration was only just beginning to cross the
Mississippi, it scarcely weighed in the balance with commerce,
but was as sure to follow it as grass to grow
or water run.
</p>

<p>
Our Government having thus cleared the way, the St.
Louis traders were not slow to avail themselves of it.
In 1808 they organized the Missouri Fur Company,
which immediately sent an agent into the coveted territory,
where he set up a trading-house known as Post
Henry on the Lewis River.
</p>

<p>
John Jacob Astor, a merchant of New York, conceived
the idea of carrying out the whole scheme as
formulated in Mr. Jefferson's mind, not as a monopolist,
protected by Government with exclusive privileges, but
as a private person, who undertakes an enterprise on
his own judgment, and backs it up with his own means.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Astor was a shrewd and careful merchant who
had grown very wealthy from the profits of the fur-trade.
He had the money. He knew the price of a
beaver or an otter skin in every market of the world.
He had the whole A B C of commerce at his fingers'
ends. Uniformly successful in whatever he undertook,
his judgment inspired confidence in others, as superior
business tact is sure to do; hence Mr. Astor had no
difficulty in securing partners in his enterprise. It was
seen that the key to success lay in the hands of whoever
should first occupy the rich fur-bearing valleys of
the Columbia River.
</p>

<p>
There was nothing niggardly about this princely
merchant's preparations, once he had made up his mind
to embark in the adventure. Every thing was conceived
on a most liberal scale, and nothing was left to chance.
One company of agents, clerks, and laborers was sent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_213' name='Page_213' href='#Page_213'>213</a></span>
round Cape Horn, with orders to begin a station at the
Columbia River, should they first arrive on the ground.
Another company, numbering sixty persons, either
agents, trappers, guides, or interpreters, went from St.
Louis up the Missouri and Yellowstone, and so across
the great snowy range into the Columbia basin.
</p>

<p>
This was in 1810. The next year Mr. Astor despatched
a second ship to the Columbia with further
supplies of men and means.
</p>

<p>
The Tonquin, the pioneer ship, arrived in the Columbia
before the overland party did. A site was chosen
ten miles up the river, on the south side, and the work
of erecting a trading-post begun at once, so that when
the advance of the overland party reached it (January,
1812), in the utmost destitution, they found relief
within its walls.
</p>

<p>
In honor of its projector the builders called their settlement
Astoria. Its history was destined to be brief
but eventful. In the first place, the rivalry of the British
North-west Company soon made itself felt. Its
agents spread themselves out over the upper Columbia
waters, so intercepting the Indian trade. Then news
was brought to the factory, of the taking of the Tonquin
and massacre of her crew by the Indians, with
whom she was trading, near the Straits of Fuca.
</p>

<p>
The ship Beaver, with the third detachment, arrived
out in May, 1812. She, too, sailed on a trading-voyage
up the coast. A party was sent out from
Astoria, at this time, to establish a trading-post on the
Spokane River, which, with one already begun at
Okonagon, was the second this company had formed
in the interior.
</p>

<p>
In June, 1812, war broke out between England and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_214' name='Page_214' href='#Page_214'>214</a></span>
the United States. It was January before the people at
Astoria heard of it. Finding themselves cut off from
help on the one side, and threatened with capture on
the other, Astor's agents sold the property to the North-west
Company, into whose hands it thus passed, not
without suspicion of collusion on the part of the sellers.
This was in October, 1813.
</p>

<p>
In this way an enterprise which had been sagaciously
planned, backed with abundant means, and had passed
through the preliminary stage of trial to assured success,
came to an inglorious end because the Government
lacked means to protect it. And so Americans
were ousted from Oregon, and Englishmen put in possession,
which was much like giving the wolf the wether
to keep.

LOUISIANA ADMITTED.
</h4>

<p>
Louisiana came into the Union in 1812, so making
it the eighteenth State in the order of succession, as it
was the first formed of any portion of the territory
we had acquired west of the Mississippi. Louisiana is
therefore the corner-stone of the new Great West.
</p>

<p>
Louisiana came in at the beginning of a period of
strife and bloodshed. England made a most desperate
effort to seize New Orleans, with intent to obtain control
of the Mississippi, or at least to gain a vantage-ground
from which she could dictate terms to the United
States. The fortune of war, however, went against her
in the bloodiest battle of the time. Peace was already
made when it was fought, so making the effort as useless
as it was costly and heroic.

<h3>
III.
<br />
THE OREGON TRAIL.
</h3>

<hr />

<h4>
THE TRAPPER, THE BACKWOODSMAN, AND THE
EMIGRANT.
</h4>

<p>
Ever since the expedition of Lewis and Clarke, the
head waters of the Missouri had been frequented
by hunters, trappers, and traders. These men threaded
every nook and corner of the wilderness in pursuit of a
livelihood, and, rude geographers as they were, the remotest
mountain solitudes were fast yielding up to them
the secrets they had held since the creation of the
world.
</p>

<p>
Let us begin with a portrait of the trapper as drawn
from life by Mr. Irving:—
</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"When the trade in furs was chiefly pursued about the lakes
and rivers, the expeditions were carried on in bateaux and canoes.
The voyageurs or boatmen were the rank and file in the service of
the trader, and even the hardy men of the North were fain to be
paddled from point to point of their migrations.
</p>

<p>
"A totally different class has now sprung up,—the 'mountaineers,'
the traders and trappers that scale the vast mountain chains,
and pursue their hazardous vocations amidst their wild recesses.
They move from place to place on horseback. The equestrian
exercises, therefore, in which they are engaged, the nature of the
countries they traverse, vast plains and mountains, seem to make
them physically and mentally a more lively race than the fur-traders
and trappers of former days. A man who bestrides a horse
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_216' name='Page_216' href='#Page_216'>216</a></span>
must be essentially different from a man who cowers in a canoe.
We find them, accordingly, hardy, lithe, vigorous and active;
extravagant in word, in thought, and deed; heedless of hardship,
daring of danger, prodigal of the present, and thoughtless of the
future.
</p>

<p>
"The American trapper stands by himself, and is peerless for
the service of the wilderness. Drop him in the midst of the prairie,
or in the heart of the mountains, and he is never at a loss. He
notices every landmark, can retrace his route through the most
monotonous plains or the most perplexed labyrinths of the mountains.
No danger nor difficulty can appal him, and he scorns to
complain under any privation."
</p>

<p>
Behind the trapper, though it might be at a great
distance, came the backwoodsman. This man was a
product of American growth, of continued expansion of
territory, but never the voluntary agent of civilization.
He was more like the foam blown from the crest of its
ever-advancing wave.
</p>

<p>
The true backwoodsman was one, who, like Daniel
Boone, fled at the approach of his fellow-men. He was
a recluse from choice. He has always hung on to the
skirts of civilization, though he scorned to become
part of it, or profit by its advantages or comforts.
</p>

<p>
This man made a little clearing, built himself a rude
cabin of logs, and lived by hunting. When he first
heard of a new purchase he hastened to it, but as soon
as another was made he shouldered his rifle and his
pack, and without regret turned his back upon the
home he had scarcely made habitable when this new fit
of restlessness sent him forth in search of another. In
this manner, his lonely clearing made smooth the way
for the coming settler. Thus the backwoodsman's life
was passed far from the haunts of men. Free from all
desire to better his condition in any ennobling sense,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_217' name='Page_217' href='#Page_217'>217</a></span>
he had no higher aspiration than to live apart, no
thought of becoming an instrumentality in the hand
of progress. In his habits and way of life he was
more like an Indian than a civilized being, for the only
school he had been educated in was nature's, and his
tastes or instincts led him rather downward than upward
in the scale of human effort.
</p>

<img src="images/i-228.jpg" width="220" height="198" alt="" />
<p class="caption">AN EMIGRANT'S CAMP.</p>
</div>

<p>
Behind the backwoodsman,
like the vanguard of an
army taking the field,
came the emigrant.
The tread of
his oxen,
and print of
his wagon-wheels,
followed
close
in the blazed
footpath of
the departing
pioneer.
On foot he
trudged at
the head of his worldly possessions, as light of heart as
the birds singing in the forest around him. In the
wagon his household utensils would be stowed away,
with wife and little ones, while his bronzed and barefooted
boys, on foot and in homespun, drove the cows
and hogs along the road behind it. At nightfall the
wagon would be drawn up by the side of some limpid
brook, the animals turned loose to crop the tender
grass, while with an armful of fagots, gathered close at
hand, the goodwife was soon busy cooking a frugal
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_218' name='Page_218' href='#Page_218'>218</a></span>
supper of bacon and potatoes, over the embers of their
camp-fire. In this way the emigrant sometimes travelled
week after week, and month after month, before
finding a place of abode to suit him.
</p>

<p>
This man had come to stay. When he had found a
situation to his mind, he set about felling trees for his
cabin. On the Missouri, where the first settlers chiefly
came from Tennessee and Kentucky, this dwelling was
usually two houses, built a little apart from each other,
each containing but one room, and joined together only
by the roof, so leaving an opening in the centre, where
the family usually sat in the heat of the day. The
chimneys were built of sticks, plastered with clay, and
stood at the outside of the building, as the fashion is
in the Southern States. There was little difference between
the dwellings of rich and poor. In these humble
abodes the first generation grew up to man's estate to
find themselves to-day the founders of an empire.
</p>

<p>
Unlike the backwoodsman, the settler had come to
better his condition,—to grow up with the country,
not abandon it with the first token of progress. Here
he lived content. He broke up his forty acres of
prairie land, fenced and planted it, and from its fertility
soon reaped an abundant harvest of corn and potatoes,
which with his swine and poultry, furnished more than
food enough for his wants. Though the comforts of life
were scarcely attainable in a wilderness, he had the
necessaries, and could say, with our gracious poet, to
the dweller in cities,—
</p>

<h4>
LONG EXPLORES THE PLATTE VALLEY.
</h4>

<p>
From the summit of Pike's Peak, Pike, the explorer,
had looked down upon regions watered by four great
rivers,—the Platte,<a name='FA_176' id='FA_176' href='#FN_176' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> Arkansas, Rio Grande and Colorado.
Into those dark gorges he had recklessly plunged.
But he had scarcely done more than confirm the position
of the great landmark, which nature has placed at the
head of these great rivers.
</p>

<p>
War with England had put a stop to exploration for
a time, but with peace it was determined to know if the
Platte would not afford a better route than the roundabout
one Lewis and Clarke had followed to the Pacific.
It was thought depressions might exist where this river
issued from the mountains, so giving access to the country
on the other side, by a way less formidable to the
traveller than had yet been found.
</p>

<p>
With this object in view, Major Long<a name='FA_177' id='FA_177' href='#FN_177' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> was sent to
the Missouri in 1819 by President Monroe. As he was
a man of scientific attainments, a more thorough and
critical report was expected from him than his predecessors
had so far furnished.
</p>

<p>
Long's journey marks a distinct era in the ways
of travel; for while Pike had used row-boats, Long
ascended the Missouri in a steamboat built for the
purpose at Pittsburg, and named the "Western Engineer."
In this vessel he made the voyage to Council
Bluffs.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="i-231" id="i-231"></a>
<img src="images/i-231.jpg" width="500" height="336" alt="" />
<p class="caption">MAP SHOWING LONG'S EXPLORATIONS.</p>
</div>

<p>
In going up the Missouri, Long found the most populous
settlements growing up in the neighborhood of
St. Charles, in what is now Callaway County, and in
that part lying between the Osage and Chariton.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_220' name='Page_220' href='#Page_220'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_221' name='Page_221' href='#Page_221'>221</a></span>
Above the Chariton only a horse-path, called a trace,
led northward to Council Bluffs.
</p>

<p>
In all these primitive settlements superior wealth
would be indicated by the number and size of the corn-cribs,
smoke-houses, etc., but nothing resembling the
barn found on every farm in the Northern States entered
into the make-up of these frontier homesteads.
</p>

<p>
After spending the winter in camp near Council
Bluffs, Long passed on his way into the Platte, to the
village of the Otoe nation, situated about forty miles
above the confluence of the Platte with the Missouri.
Going thence he entered the Pawnee country, finding
there a more friendly welcome than Pike had met with,
but, like him, getting an impression of savage chivalry
and independence, the like of which he had found nowhere
else. The braves of this nation hung out their
war-shields in the village streets, as the cavaliers of old
were accustomed to display
theirs before their
tents, so that every passerby
might know who the
occupant was by his device.
</p>

<img src="images/i-232.jpg" width="200" height="145" alt="" />
<p class="caption">PRAIRIE-DOG VILLAGE.</p>
</div>

<p>
Long's party turned
down the South Fork of
the Platte, and reached
the mountains in July, 1820, after making a journey
of nearly a thousand miles since leaving the Missouri.
</p>

<p>
In one place this traveller has noted down how they
had passed by a large and uncommonly beautiful village
of the prairie marmot, covering a grassy plain of
about a mile square. As they came toward it, this spot
happened to be covered with a herd of some thousands
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_222' name='Page_222' href='#Page_222'>222</a></span>
of bisons. On the left were a number of wild horses,
and immediately in front twenty or thirty antelopes,
and about half as many deer. As it was near sunset the
light fell obliquely upon the grass, giving an additional
brilliancy to its dark verdure. The little inhabitants
of the village were seen running playfully about in all
directions, and when the travellers got near them, they
sat erect on their burrows, and gave a short, sharp bark
of alarm.
</p>

<p>
A scene of this kind comprised most of what was
beautiful and interesting to the passing traveller in the
wide unvaried
plains of the
Missouri and
Arkansas.
</p>

<p>
Before leaving
this interesting
region,
Dr. James, the
botanist and
historian of
the expedition,
ascended the high mountain now known as Long's
Peak (July 13). Turning south, Long's party soon
struck the waters of the Arkansas, near Pike's Peak,
from whose summits they saw the great plain they had
crossed, "rising as it receded until it appeared to mingle
with the sky."

<p class="caption">DIGGING IN THE RIVER-BED FOR WATER.</p>
</div>

<p>
From this point, the explorers descended the valleys
of the Arkansas and its largest tributary, the Canadian,
to Fort Smith, and from thence through the growing
settlements of the territory,<a name='FA_178' id='FA_178' href='#FN_178' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> to the Mississippi, visiting,
by the way, the famous Hot Springs of the Washita.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_223' name='Page_223' href='#Page_223'>223</a></span>
The upper waters of the Arkansas and Platte were
reported by them to lie in sandy wastes unfit for occupation
by civilized man. Often the explorers would
have to dig in the bed of the river to get water, while
the arid appearance of every thing around, caused by the
disappearance of the rivers<a name='FA_179' id='FA_179' href='#FN_179' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> beneath their own sands,
the want of wood and absence of game, stamped the
whole region as one on which nature had set the seal
of perpetual barrenness and desolation.
</p>

<p>
The sum of these discoveries had traced out, as it
were, the larger veins through which emigration, the
life-blood of the country, was ultimately to flow.

<h4>
MISSOURI, AND THE COMPROMISE OF 1821.
</h4>

<p>
Far back, when the original States were yet colonies,
and while the people of Massachusetts were solemnly
deliberating how to deliver themselves from oppression,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_224' name='Page_224' href='#Page_224'>224</a></span>
a letter was read to the body to whom this grave question
had been committed, asking it to consider the state
of the negro slaves in the province.
</p>

<p>
These men had just said they were called rebels because
they would not be slaves. The dilemma was thus
presented to them, either to make good their declaration,
or limit its application to themselves. After some
debate the matter was dropped, but the plea for a principle
had been uttered, the appeal to men's consciences
taken, and as some secret cause, working beneath the
waters, gives notice of the agitation below by sending
up bubbles to the surface, so this question of slavery
continued at intervals to prick the conscience of the
people, and confront them at every turn with its
warning.

The North had got rid of slavery. It had done more.
Its voice had excluded slavery from the great North-West.
But the South owed its growth to slave labor,
and wherever her people went to found new States they
carried their slaves with them. It was inevitable, that,
whenever free and slave labor should meet on the same
ground, a conflict must arise between them, though
statesmen were anxious to avert the coming on of strife
as long as possible.
</p>

<p>
It is hard to stay the march of events, or confute the
logic of time. Even as far back as the beginning of
the Union, men had foreseen the coming storm, with
foreboding, yet these men were no wiser than the Massachusetts
men of 1774; for at the time of the Union
slavery might have been so restricted that it would
eventually have died out in the land, or a way provided
for the gradual emancipation of the blacks. Such steps
were indeed talked of, but not consummated. So the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_225' name='Page_225' href='#Page_225'>225</a></span>
nation was allowed to drift on, and the two opposing
systems were left to work out their own results.
</p>

<p>
In 1819 Missouri asked for admission into the Union.
Her doing so, with a constitution recognizing slavery,
proved a rock of danger to the Republic, the wisest
statesmen found it hard to steer clear of. It provoked
violent opposition at the North, and equally vehement
support in the South. Under French rule the people
of the nascent State held slaves. Those who had since
come in were mostly from slaveholding States, and
wanted to have slavery recognized as part of their
social and political system.
</p>

<p>
They demanded this, not as a privilege, but as a right
guaranteed to them by the Constitution itself, in which
property in slaves was distinctly recognized. So they
stood firm for what they considered their rights, defending
slavery from the charge of immorality, or inhumanity
of man to man, as men would the most righteous cause.
</p>

<p>
The North contended, broadly, that slavery was a
crime, discountenanced by Christian people and enlightened
thought everywhere, of which the nation should
purge itself. It was said that the idea of a nation being
free, when it countenanced holding men in bondage,
was a mockery of freedom. Many construed the ordinance
of 1787 to have forbidden, if not in its letter, at
least in spirit, the formation of slave States out of newly
acquired territory. But these men did not propose to
interfere with slavery in the States where it already
existed.
</p>

<p>
Around these two differing ideas the men of the North
and South clustered themselves. Underlying all, and
governing all, was the conviction that a check to the
extension of slavery meant a check to the political
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_226' name='Page_226' href='#Page_226'>226</a></span>
power of the South itself. This view made the South
a unit, while in the North public sentiment was divided,
for many there deprecated agitation of the question, as
the entering wedge which should split the Republic
asunder.
</p>

<p>
When, therefore, Congress took up the bill for the
admission of Missouri, the opponents of slavery met it
with the condition that no slaves should afterward be
brought into the new State, while all children, born
in it subsequent to its admission, should be free at the
age of twenty-five years. In time this condition would
have made Missouri a free State.
</p>

<p>
The matter was hotly debated. Of the twenty-two
States then constituting the Union, ten were slave
States. Two ominous phrases began to be heard. One
was "State rights," the other "Balance of power." In
the violence of party strife, patriotism was lost sight of.
</p>

<p>
The House of Representatives refused to admit Missouri
without the condition; the Senate refused to do
so with it. So Missouri was not admitted at this time.
</p>

<p>
With the two houses thus divided, it was apparent
that no new State could be admitted, since the Southern
party, having control of the Senate, would not vote to
admit a free State so long as Missouri was kept out,
and Maine was then ready to come in as a free State.
</p>

<p>
As neither party would yield, the more moderate, or
timid, men of each tried to find some intermediate
ground where the factions could come together, each
giving up something for the sake of restoring harmony
to the country. Finally a settlement was reached.
Maine came in a free State. Missouri was admitted
with slavery, but with the restriction attached that her
southern boundary should thenceforward be the limit
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_227' name='Page_227' href='#Page_227'>227</a></span>
north of which no new slave States should be formed.
Thus the line between freedom and slavery was first
strictly drawn on the parallel of 36° 30´, but with a
slave State above it. The first battle between the two
warring systems had been fought, and slavery had won.
The North had got a line, but the South had won
a State.

ARKANSAS ADMITTED 1836.
</h4>

<p>
Arkansas was admitted into the Union in 1836, as
a slave State, retaining the name it had been given
as a Territory, when formed from the Louisiana purchase,—a
name originating with the once powerful
nation Marquette found seated on the banks of the
Mississippi. Thus three slave States had been made
out of French Louisiana.

<h4>
THOMAS H. BENTON'S IDEA.
<br />
<span class="s08">
"<i>There is the East! There lies the road to India.</i>"
</span>
</h4>

<p>
Lawyer, soldier and politician, but not yet a statesman,
Thomas H. Benton went from Tennessee to
Missouri after the war with England was over. Though
St. Louis was yet only a large village, it was the
focus of the activities of the Great West. Mr. Benton
saw it was the place for a rising man to grow up in,
and accordingly he settled there.
</p>

<p>
In St. Louis Mr. Benton found an aristocracy of fur-traders,
whose attachment for their own usages and old
form of government bound them together. They kept
their own language and manners. With many it was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_228' name='Page_228' href='#Page_228'>228</a></span>
a point of honor never to learn English at all. In all
things they were as distinctively French as the French
people of Canada are to-day. Thus this scion of refinement
had been grafted on a rude frontier life, but
would not assimilate with the coarser elements thrown
upon it by emigration from the States.
</p>

<p>
By the side of this middle-class (<i>bourgeois</i>) aristocracy
stood the Catholic clergy, with its traditions of the old
<i>régime</i> in Canada, its proud record of discovery and
missionary work among the barbarians of these Western
wilds, whose every stream and fountain had its story
of zeal and heroism to tell.
</p>

<p>
This was society at the core. The clergy was its rock
of support. Boys were taught in the parish school, and
girls in a nunnery. So education was as much in the
keeping of the Church as religion itself. Nations may
change, but the Roman Church never abandons its
people or its objects.
</p>

<p>
Around this foundation was grouped the community
of French Creoles, whom the great fur companies employed
and who were their dependants. And around
them clustered again an increasing population of American
adventurers, coming mostly from the Southern
States in search of a living, for whom St. Louis was
the magnet which attracts to itself the scattered atoms
of society far and near.
</p>

<p>
Outside of St. Louis, Missouri owed her rapid growth
to the in-coming of actual settlers. In 1816 only thirty
families were found on the left bank of the Missouri,
above Callaway County. In three years the number
had increased to eight hundred families. Here was
the real bone and sinew of the State.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Benton found the American Fur-Trading Company
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_229' name='Page_229' href='#Page_229'>229</a></span>
sending forth its yearly caravans over the great
plains to the mountains, and from the mountains,
through passes known only to the Indians and fur-traders,
into Sonora, New Mexico and Oregon. Since
the way was beset by hostile Indians, these caravans
went armed to the teeth. The same Indians might
fight them one day and trade the next. In time, the
passing to and fro of these traders had
marked out well-beaten paths up the
Arkansas and the Platte, which presently
came to be known on the frontier
as the Santa Fé Trail and Oregon
Trail.<a name='FA_180' id='FA_180' href='#FN_180' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a>
</p>

<p>
At bottom the St. Louis fur-traders
were not more friendly to colonization
than the English fur-traders, but they
were quite as eager to push their business
into Oregon, conceiving they had
the best right there, as the English
companies were to keep them out of
it so that they themselves might reap
all the profit; and so there was rivalry
and ill blood between them.
</p>

<div class="figright">

<img src="images/i-240.jpg" width="150" height="367" alt="" />
<p class="caption">STATUE OF BENTON.</p>
</div>

<p>
Mr. Benton was energetic, ambitious
and self-reliant, qualities which soon identified him with
the thought and interests of the people among whom
he had cast in his lot in life. Thoroughly Southern in
his feelings, he had borne an active part in making
Missouri a slave State, and when that result was accomplished
the people sent him to the United States Senate
as a reward for his zeal in their behalf.
</p>

<p>
When the war with England was over, our Government
wished to have the boundary between our own
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_230' name='Page_230' href='#Page_230'>230</a></span>
and the British possessions defined and settled. Though
proposed to be run on the forty-ninth parallel it had
never been done, and in buying Louisiana we inherited
a dispute which, so long as that vast region was unexplored
and unknown, had slept, but was now become a
source of irritation and danger between England and
the United States. The Columbia River and its basin<a name='FA_181' id='FA_181' href='#FN_181' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a>
were the bone of contention. Both wanted them.
Neither would give them up. Since Astoria<a name='FA_182' id='FA_182' href='#FN_182' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> had been
sold, the Hudson's Bay and North-west Companies had
held uninterrupted possession of the whole country, to
the exclusion of our own ships and traders, whose
interests had suffered in consequence; but as England
would not yield her pretensions peaceably, the people
of the Atlantic coast were unwilling to go to war
about a region so remote, the more so because they
were just recovering from the effects of the one lately
ended, and felt that they would be the greatest sufferers
if war again broke out between the two nations.
</p>

<p>
So the two countries compromised their differences
by agreeing to hold Oregon in common, first for ten
years (1818-1828), and afterward from year to year.
All this time England was growing stronger in Oregon,
and the United States losing the hold her citizens
had first obtained there, for though it was neutral
ground on paper, the English with their free access
by land and sea were able to shut out our traders, and
did so.
</p>

<p>
This state of things was humiliating to the West.
It was as though the nation were eating humble-pie
rather than offend England. Continual agitation of
the question served to keep up a feverish feeling about
Oregon, but since Major Long had said it was of no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_231' name='Page_231' href='#Page_231'>231</a></span>
use to think of cultivating the land between the
meridian of Council Bluffs and the Rocky Mountains,
it seemed settled that nobody but fur-traders would
want to cross this desert while so much fertile land
remained vacant in the Mississippi and Missouri Valleys.
If settlement must stop at the edge of this
desert, then the idea of geographical unity vanished,
and Oregon would, in truth, be worth little to us.
Mr. Benton, himself, was at one time of this opinion.
</p>

<p>
So when Mr. Benton wanted the Government to take
Oregon with an armed force, he was told it was not
worth the trouble, for Oregon could never become a
State if we did.
</p>

<p>
There was another element to the dispute, which
found much favor in the West. This was Mr. Monroe's
declaration that no European power would be allowed
to subdue or overturn the independent governments
of our continent. This was a notice to England that
she could not have Oregon. It has since been known
as the Monroe Doctrine,<a name='FA_183' id='FA_183' href='#FN_183' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> and so Mr. Monroe became
the author of a national policy.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Benton mastered all the details of the vexatious
Oregon question. The interests of his constituents
were at stake. His patriotism was aroused. He felt
equal disgust with the artifices by which England kept
us out of Oregon, as with the cautious spirit of the
East, which counted the cost of every thing beforehand,
less, it seemed to him, in the spirit of statesmanship,
than for what it would be worth at the present
moment.
</p>

<p>
It should not be forgotten, however, that New England
enterprise had first made known the resources of
our possessions on the Pacific.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_232' name='Page_232' href='#Page_232'>232</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In fine, Mr. Benton made himself the champion of
the growing West. He had already become, in a sense,
the trustee of Mr. Jefferson's pet scheme of a great
overland highway to India, which, indeed, proved too
great for the time that wise man lived in, but only
waited for the people to grow up to it. Mr. Benton
knew from Mr. Jefferson's own lips what results had
been hoped for, but not realized,—how the best-laid
plans had been thwarted, or suffered to sleep the sleep
of oblivion,—and the Missouri senator had gone away
from his memorable interview more than ever impressed
with the greatness of the mission he was henceforth to
take upon himself as Mr. Jefferson's disciple.
</p>

<p>
England managed, in one or another way, to delay
a settlement just forty-nine years. A few Americans
had gone into Oregon, but as yet they were only a
handful. In 1832 Captain Bonneville<a name='FA_184' id='FA_184' href='#FN_184' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> took the first
wagon train across the Wind River chain into the
Green River Valley, thus proving the mountains were
practicable for vehicles. The same year Nathaniel J.
Wyeth<a name='FA_185' id='FA_185' href='#FN_185' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a> led a party all the way from New England to
Fort Vancouver, after a journey lasting seven months,
in which some of his men were killed by the Blackfeet.
In 1834 and 1835 some American missionaries<a name='FA_186' id='FA_186' href='#FN_186' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a> were
sent out to Oregon, one of whom, Marcus Whitman,
was to figure largely in its history. In the following
year Dr. Whitman went through to Fort Walla Walla
with a wagon, thus doing what had been declared
impossible. Yet up to the close of 1841 not quite a
hundred and fifty Americans, in all, had settled in
Oregon, though the Oregon Trail was largely shorn of
its terrors by the intrepidity of these real pathfinders.
For his part, Dr. Whitman saw clearly, that, since
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_233' name='Page_233' href='#Page_233'>233</a></span>
diplomacy was purposely hindering it, emigration must
step in and settle the question who should have Oregon.
And Dr. Whitman was not only a man of clear sight,
but of action.

Sault Ste. Marie, had taken possession of

Whatever rights France acquired became

We thus became possessed of

<h4>
WITH THE VANGUARD TO OREGON.
<br />
<span class="s08">
"<i>This army does not retreat!</i>"
</span>
</h4>

<p>
Emigration was to be our army of occupation in
Oregon. In this conviction Mr. Benton was looking
about him for the means to set it in motion, when he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_234' name='Page_234' href='#Page_234'>234</a></span>
chanced to meet Lieutenant John C. Fremont, of the
topographical engineers, who had just returned from
surveying the Upper Mississippi, with Nicollet.<a name='FA_187' id='FA_187' href='#FN_187' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a>
</p>

<p>
Mr. Benton wanted the Oregon route surveyed in
aid of emigration to the Lower Columbia. The subject
led to an intimacy between the two men, in the
course of which Fremont fell in love with Mr. Benton's
daughter Jessie, whom a little later he married, so
uniting his fortunes with the distinguished senator's
family, as well as his plans.
</p>

<p>
It resulted in sending Fremont (1842) to find out
whether the South Pass<a name='FA_188' id='FA_188' href='#FN_188' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> of the Rocky Mountains, the
usual crossing-place, would best accommodate the coming
emigration.
</p>

<p>
This was the very first step taken by our Government
in aid of emigration to Oregon. Hitherto it had
reflected the prevailing belief in the worthlessness of
Oregon for any such purpose. We were, at this time,
thick in the dispute with England about the boundary,
and so the expedition was rather assented to, in deference
to Western men, than authorized as a Government
measure.
</p>

<p>
St. Louis is no longer to be considered as a starting-point
for the mountains. Already this had gone three
hundred and fifty miles west. Fremont's journey therefore
began at the little village of Kansas,<a name='FA_189' id='FA_189' href='#FN_189' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> now a city
larger than any then existing west of the Alleghanies,
but then only a landing for Chouteau's trading-post,
ten miles up the Kansas River. From this place, early
in June, Fremont's party set out for the mountains.
Kit Carson of Taos, a famous hunter, was their guide.
</p>

<p>
For most of the way Fremont's wagons only followed
in the track of those that had gone before them, sometimes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_235' name='Page_235' href='#Page_235'>235</a></span>
with guides, but oftener without them. The road
was plain, and led over ground where vehicles pass everywhere
with ease, except when gullies or streams cross
their path. So Fremont's men journeyed on quite at
their ease. At nightfall the wagons were drawn
together in a circle, thus forming an enclosed and
barricaded camp, in which the travellers pitched their
tents.
</p>

<p>
Fremont went up the Kansas valley as far as the
Big Blue, crossing thence over to the Platte, which was
now to be his
guide for the
rest of his journey.
</p>

<div class="figright">
<a name="i-246" id="i-246"></a>
<img src="images/i-246.jpg" width="220" height="128" alt="" />
<p class="caption">FORT LARAMIE.</p>
</div>

<p>
Now and then
Fremont would
come across the
abandoned camp
of some Oregon
emigrants,
who thus seemed piloting him on, instead of he them.
</p>

<p>
At the forks of the Platte the party was divided,
Fremont himself going down the South Fork, to St.
Vrain's Fort,<a name='FA_190' id='FA_190' href='#FN_190' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> while the rest kept on up the North
Fork, to Fort Laramie,<a name='FA_191' id='FA_191' href='#FN_191' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> where Fremont presently
joined them again.
</p>

<p>
When firewood grew scarce the men would have to
make their fires of dried buffalo-dung, as the Arabs of
the desert do with that of the camel.
</p>

<p>
At Laramie, Fremont learned that the mountains
beyond swarmed with Indians, who were out on the
war-path, and had declared the road shut to the whites.
But Fremont went on to the South Pass, which was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_236' name='Page_236' href='#Page_236'>236</a></span>
found to rise by so gradual an ascent that the exploring
party hardly knew when they had reached its
summit.
</p>

<p>
In the valley beyond this pass, the explorers rested.
Before turning back, Fremont himself, with a few
others, made their way into the mountains and up to
the summit of the high peak now known by his name,
which rose, the monarch of all in this region, 13,570
feet above the sea. In this way the three greatest
landmarks of the Rockies make memorable the names
of three explorers, Pike, Long and Fremont.
</p>

<p>
While Fremont did little that had not been done
already, his careful record of distances, fords, camping-places
where grass, wood and water could be had, was
just what outgoing emigrants needed to know, and so,
immediately, they began to go forward with confidence.
It was besides a token that Government had taken
hold of the matter at last, and would, it was thought,
now foster and protect the emigration.
</p>

<p>
Fremont said it would be necessary to have permanent
military posts at Laramie, St. Vrain's and Bent's
Fort, to keep the Indians from killing our people, as
they passed through their country. Until this should
be done the road could not be called safe. But he did
the most for emigration in correcting the popular error
about the barrenness of the great plains, to which
Major Long gave currency, and which everybody to this
time had believed. He showed that where the buffalo
roamed in such vast herds, and found food, could not be
a desert, for the wild grass they lived on would certainly
keep the emigrants' cattle, while no man need
starve in the midst of such abundance of wild game
as constantly roved these plains before their eyes. It
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_237' name='Page_237' href='#Page_237'>237</a></span>
was much to have all these things set down in an
orderly manner by some friendly hand, and with the
seal of Government authority. Fremont did this as it
had not been done before.
</p>

<p>
Fremont's first expedition met with such favor that
he was immediately sent on a second (1843), and
much more important one. This time he was to begin
at the South Pass, and go through the Lower Columbia
country. He was well on his
way when the War Department
suddenly recalled
him to Washington,
but Mrs. Fremont
took the responsibility
of suppressing
the order
until the explorer
was too
far off for it to
reach him.
</p>

<p class="caption">AMOLE, OR SOAP-PLANT OF THE PLAINS.</p>
</div>

<p>
At the moment
of starting
from the
Missouri, Fremont met a large party of emigrants who
were going to California under the lead of J. B. Childs.
This party took with them that modern civilizing engine,
a saw-mill, ready to be put up on reaching the
Sacramento. As Fremont moved west, trains of wagons
were seldom out of sight. The great march had begun
in earnest.
</p>

<p>
Fremont decided to explore the mountains in the
neighborhood of St. Vrain's Fort to see if they would
afford a practicable passage on a more direct east-and-west
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_238' name='Page_238' href='#Page_238'>238</a></span>
line than the old way up the Platte. He therefore
struck into them, north of Long's Peak, and by following
the Cache-à-la-Poudre<a name='FA_192' id='FA_192' href='#FN_192' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a> River came out on the
other side, where his journey of the previous year had
ended. From here he passed on into the valley of
Bear River, and so on to the Great Salt Lake,<a name='FA_193' id='FA_193' href='#FN_193' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a> which
he also explored.
</p>

<p>
From Salt Lake, Fremont went north to the Hudson's
Bay Company's post at Fort Hall, striking the Oregon
Trail again by the way. The explorers divided here,
part going back to the States and part down the
river with Fremont. Fort Boisé<a name='FA_194' id='FA_194' href='#FN_194' class='fnanchor'>[8]</a> they found was only
an ordinary dwelling-house. Going on they next came
to the mission Dr. Whitman had founded among the
Nez Percés, near Walla Walla. It then consisted of
but one adobe house, though more were going up
around it. Its cornfields and potato-patches, which
Dr. Whitman had cleared and planted, were a pleasant
sight to men worn down with travel and fasting, but
not more so to Fremont than the little colony of emigrants
now collected here after their long march of
two thousand miles,—men, women and children,—all
in robust health, and all regaling themselves with Dr.
Whitman's potatoes.
</p>

<p>
Fort Walla Walla marks an important strategic point
in the early movement of emigration to Oregon. Situated
only nine miles below the junction of the two
great branches of the Columbia, it was thus also
planted at the meeting of two great trans-continental
routes of travel, one coming from the United States by
way of the South Pass, the other from Hudson's Bay
by way of Lake Athabasca and the mountain passes
near it. For such of the emigrants as chose to go on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_239' name='Page_239' href='#Page_239'>239</a></span>
by water, Walla Walla was the end of their long overland
journey. Fremont found a large body of emigrants,
under the lead of Mr. Jesse Applegate, building
bateaux here to go down the river in.
</p>

<p>
But the British trading-post lay on a sandy plain,
where scarce a blade of grass or a shrub grew. Dr.
Whitman had chosen a pleasant and fertile nook, not
far from the fort, where emigrants might recruit themselves
among friends; for at the fort itself every
effort was made to turn them back or send them into
California. Thus everywhere, except at the missions,
emigrants found this Oregon Trail a hard road to
travel, for our Government left them to the mercy of
the Hudson's Bay Company's agents, who hindered them
in every way, or failing to stop them, charged exorbitantly
for every thing furnished.
</p>

<p>
Finding emigration would increase in spite of them,
this company chose to save itself by bringing in British
emigrants from the Red River of the North. It meant
to occupy the best lands, as it had the best trading
sites. The first colony was on the Upper Columbia
when Dr. Whitman heard of it. If Oregon were to be
saved to us, there was not a moment to lose. He
instantly started for Washington with the news of this
threatened invasion.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Whitman's ride to St. Louis, by way of Santa
Fé, will ever be memorable in the annals of Oregon, as
well for its perils as for what it accomplished. He
found our Government had just signed the Ashburton
Treaty,<a name='FA_195' id='FA_195' href='#FN_195' class='fnanchor'>[9]</a> by which Oregon was still left out in the cold,
without a boundary or the protection of our laws or flag.
His great energy, however, enabled him to get together
on the frontier an emigrants' train of two hundred
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_240' name='Page_240' href='#Page_240'>240</a></span>
wagons with which, as the leader of an army, he
started back in the spring. It was these people whom
Fremont had seen setting out, had tracked a thousand
miles on their way, and finally come up with at their
journey's end. As the Government would not lead, it
now had to follow the people's grand march for the
Pacific.
</p>

<p>
With fresh horses Fremont pushed on down the
left bank of the Columbia to the Dalles, Mount Hood
towering in the distance. Here the whole river rushes
through a long and narrow trough of rock, with so
swift a tide that in the season of high water boats cannot
stem it.
</p>

<p>
A few miles below, Fremont emerged from the sterile
and inhospitable region through which he had been
travelling, upon a green spot in the valley, where,
among groves of noble forest-trees, the Methodist mission
had reared its two dwellings, its one schoolhouse,
and its barn, cleared ground for planting, gathered to
it a colony of Indians for instruction in the ways and
religion of the whites, and so dropped in the wilderness
the seed of Christian civilization.
</p>

<p>
From the Dalles, Fremont sailed down the river to
Vancouver, finding here still more emigrants, most of
whom were waiting to cross over into the fertile
Willamette Valley, which was then their land of
promise.
</p>

<p>
At this point Fremont's journey ended. His explorations
had now connected with surveys conducted by
Captain Wilkes from the Pacific coast. Fremont
therefore turned homeward again, taking with him the
most exact knowledge of the country traversed, so far
obtained.

<h4>
TEXAS ADMITTED.
</h4>

<p>
Mexico threw off her allegiance to Spain in 1821.
Not till then did the Spaniards in Mexico abandon
their policy of excluding all foreigners from their soil;
but the example set them by the United States, with
the feeling born of freedom from the Spanish yoke,
brought about a change of policy in this regard, and
Americans were invited to settle in Texas on the most
generous terms. No stronger instance is found of the
influence exerted by free institutions from without upon
the hereditary prejudices of a whole people. It confessed
a failure nobly.
</p>

<p>
When Texas was thus thrown open to emigration
her settlements were few and scattered. Habitual
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_242' name='Page_242' href='#Page_242'>242</a></span>
timidity or indolence had restricted them to the neighborhood
of fortified posts or missions.<a name='FA_196' id='FA_196' href='#FN_196' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> The chief ones
were San Antonio, Goliad, Refugio and Nacodoches,
and around these small parcels of land had been brought
under cultivation. But the missions themselves, which
had formed the groundwork of Spanish occupation,
were fallen into irremediable decay. The Indians who
had been gathered into them by the monks had dwindled
away until the missions
were mostly depopulated.
Here, as in
California, experience had shown that the natives could
not exist under the shadow of the whites. Civilization
wasted them away.
</p>

</div>

<p>
To induce settlers to come into Texas, they were
offered exemption from all taxes for the space of ten
years.
</p>

<p>
Among the first to avail themselves of these offers
was Stephen F. Austin, of Durham, Conn. Acting
under a grant of lands made by the Mexican authorities
to his father, Austin began a settlement on the Brazos in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_243' name='Page_243' href='#Page_243'>243</a></span>
1821, which later became the capital of the State, of
which he was the foremost founder.
</p>

<p>
Emigration poured in from the Lower Mississippi
Valley,—from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi,—and
even the older States contributed to swell the tide.
The law forbade slavery, but many brought negroes with
them and held them in spite of it. Many were adventurers
who held law in little estimation, or found in
Texas a convenient asylum from the pursuit of their
creditors. Others were poor people whom the liberal
offers of the Mexican Government lured from their
homes in the hope of bettering their condition. Though
sound at the heart, in no long time Texas had won for
itself an unenviable name throughout the Union as the
chosen home of lawless men, through its worst elements
rising to the top.
</p>

<p>
Our Government had long coveted Texas, and had
made two unsuccessful attempts to buy it of Mexico, considering
it as an integral part of Old Louisiana, to which
we had a sort of right by the prior discovery of La Salle.
</p>

<p>
Texas, which the Spaniards had weakly settled and
feebly governed, declared herself independent of Mexico
in 1835. When this revolt took place there were more
Americans than people of Spanish blood in Texas, so
bringing over to the Texan cause the warm sympathy
and active aid of a large part of the American people.
</p>

<p>
The conflict was short and bloody. After meeting
reverses at Goliad and the Alamo,<a name='FA_197' id='FA_197' href='#FN_197' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> the Texans won
their independence by defeating the Mexican army at
San Jacinto,<a name='FA_198' id='FA_198' href='#FN_198' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> in 1836. General Samuel Houston, the
Texan leader, was subsequently made president of the
Republic of Texas, which then set up for itself upon
the model of the United States.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_244' name='Page_244' href='#Page_244'>244</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In no long time Texas applied for admission to the
Union. Too weak to maintain herself as an independent
power, her interests were now at one with the
South. Her soil, climate, and productions were much
the same. Her population was largely derived from
that source, and owned to like feelings and prejudices
with their brethren of that section. The South, therefore,
favored the admission of Texas, not only for these
general reasons, but because it would add a slave State
to the Union, as, since Missouri and Arkansas had come
in, there was no more territory, except Florida, open to
slavery under the interdicted line of 36° 30´.
</p>

<p class="caption">THE ALAMO.</p>
</div>

<p>
For this very reason the growing anti-slavery sentiment
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_245' name='Page_245' href='#Page_245'>245</a></span>
of the North strongly opposed the admission of
Texas. It was further opposed on the ground that as
Mexico had not yet acknowledged the independence of
Texas, so unfriendly an act toward Mexico would lead to
war. Moreover, Texas was of such vast extent, compared
with other States, that the bill for its admission
allowed the making
of four more new
States out of it, so
opening the door of
the Union not to
one, but several slave
States in the future.

</div>

<p>
But the North and
South did not separate
themselves into
two distinct political
factions, or their citizens
stand wholly together,
on this Texas
question. With many
it was simply a question
of national policy
or expediency. It was championed by the Democratic
party, which believed in the "manifest destiny" of the
Union to control the whole continent, while the Whig
party was conservative, and its opposition was based on
the grounds already given, which many thought equivalent
to national dishonor. Southern men were in both
parties, and Northern men in both. Each party nominated
a Southern man for President upon this issue.
This question was carried to the people in the next
national election (1844), when Clay, the Whig candidate,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_246' name='Page_246' href='#Page_246'>246</a></span>
and opponent of annexation, was defeated, and
Polk,<a name='FA_199' id='FA_199' href='#FN_199' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> the Democratic candidate and its advocate,
elected. The Congress therefore admitted Texas to the
Union, Dec. 29, 1845.

<h4>
INTERLUDE.—NEW POLITICAL IDEAS.
</h4>

<p>
"<i>Truth crushed to earth will rise again.</i>"—<i>Bryant.</i>
</p>

<p>
As yet any direct attack upon slavery was unpopular
in the North. The two antagonistic ideas of limiting
or extending it were now running a neck-and-neck
race for controlling power; but attachment for the
Union itself was stronger at the North than at the
South, whose people had been taught to consider it a
compact to be kept only during the pleasure of the several
States, or so long as their interests were promoted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_247' name='Page_247' href='#Page_247'>247</a></span>
by it. This doctrine was never taught in the North.
The prevailing sentiment there was attachment for the
Union, "one and indivisible;" while the South, under
different teachings, was weighing its worth in the balance
with slavery.
</p>

<p>
One new and potent element, however, had come into
the controversy. At the North a little band of men
pledged to work for the immediate emancipation of the
slave, and deeply in earnest, had begun a warfare that
ere long was to shake the Union to its foundations.
Though few in numbers, they were both hated and
feared. At the North they were called fanatics, at the
South abolitionists. At the North they were mobbed,
at the South a reward offered for their heads. The
North apologized for them, the South demanded they
should be put down. But though they were thus held
up to public detestation, as enemies of the Union, by
both sections, these men felt that they stood for a great
and holy principle, which surely must triumph in the
end. It made them strong. It made them respected.
They were led by William Lloyd Garrison of Massachusetts,
whose name is now spoken in the land with as
much honor as it once was with bitter scorn and hatred.
</p>

<p>
Slavery was to be openly attacked through the printing-press,
the platform, and the right of petition. The
two first agencies would reach the people, and the last
their representatives in Congress. Garrison declared
in his paper "The Liberator," that he would be heard;
and he was heard, though not till he had been dragged
through the streets of Boston with a halter round his
neck. In Congress, as the outcome of this agitation,
John Quincy Adams presented many petitions, praying
for the abolition of slavery and the slave-trade in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_248' name='Page_248' href='#Page_248'>248</a></span>
nation's capital, the District of Columbia. He was assailed
with a storm of indignation. Congress would
not receive the petitions. They continued to come in
by the hundred, some bearing thousands of names. All
were refused a hearing. The venerable Adams,—"the
Old Man Eloquent,"—then in his sixty-fifth year, was
declared an incendiary unworthy of a seat in the Capitol,
and a resolution to expel him was even introduced;
but his brave stand for the right of petition made a
hundred friends for the anti-slavery cause where one
had been before.

IOWA ADMITTED.

<p>
Iowa was the first free State to be formed out of
the Louisiana purchase. She had been admitted with

the boundaries Congress had prescribed, refused to
ratify the Act, so delaying her admission until the next

<h4>
THE WAR WITH MEXICO.
<br />
<span class="s08">"<i>You can do any thing with a bayonet but sit on it.</i>"</span>
</h4>

<p>
Those who said war would follow the annexation
of Texas were right. It was soon seen that Mexico
would not sit down quietly under her loss of territory,
or lightly pass over the affront to her national honor.
They who reckoned on her doing so forgot that if the
Spanish race is indolent, it is also brave.
</p>

<p>
When nations are resolved on war a pretext is soon
found for it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_249' name='Page_249' href='#Page_249'>249</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Texas had brought with her into the Union a dispute
with Mexico about her western boundary. She
claimed to the Rio Grande, while Mexico claimed to
the Nueces,<a name='FA_200' id='FA_200' href='#FN_200' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> thus leaving in question a tract one
hundred miles wide, extending between these rivers.
</p>

<p>
It is true the tract itself was worth little to either
party, it being mostly barren prairie land, but in a
military view the Rio Grande offered much the strongest
line of defence, and
for this reason Texas
wanted her boundary
fixed on it.
</p>

<div class="figright">

<img src="images/i-260.jpg" width="200" height="137" alt="" />
<p class="caption">MEXICAN CART.</p>
</div>

<p>
A Spanish proverb
says, "Force without
forecast is little worth."
Mexico was quietly
massing troops along
the Rio Grande, in the
disputed territory, to be ready to fight, while sounding
England to see if she would not help her against the
United States. England was too wise to do so openly,
but stood ready to take advantage of whatever the
chance of war might throw in her way. As Mexico
owed England money it was thought England would
take California as soon as fighting began, both as security
for the debt, and to get possession of a Pacific port,
which we were preventing her from doing in Oregon,
and would prevent in California. On the other hand,
if war broke out, our Government had determined to
take California itself and at once. So something more
than a question of boundary was depending on war with
Mexico.
</p>

<p>
If now Mexico had chosen to give up the boundary
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_250' name='Page_250' href='#Page_250'>250</a></span>
in dispute, without a fight, there is no telling how
the decision might have affected the future of the
United States. The question is perhaps, itself, the best
apology we can find for the war.
</p>

<p>
The quarrel having thus become ours, troops were
sent to the Lower Rio Grande to hold possession. The
Mexicans brought forces to oppose them, and fighting
began. After driving back the Mexicans at Palo
Alto, and Resaca de la Palma, our forces crossed the
Rio Grande into Mexican territory. General Zachary
Taylor commanded on
this line.
</p>

<p class="caption">MEXICAN ARASTRA, FOR GRINDING ORES.</p>
</div>

<p>
War being thus begun,
steps were taken to push
it by assembling an army
of fifty thousand volunteers,
and plans laid to
invade Mexico at different
points. In Generals
Scott, Taylor, and Wool,
we had able leaders, but
the men they had under them were mostly new to war,
being hastily levied and sent off into the field before
they could be properly trained in the use of arms.

<p>
In the North the war was unpopular.<a name='FA_201' id='FA_201' href='#FN_201' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> Its coming
was foreboded and its consequences viewed with alarm.
That section therefore looked on with indifference until
the actual fighting roused the national spirit. Then the
people, in general, heartily desired the success of our
arms, though they still deprecated the war itself.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, in the South, and particularly
the South-west, the war was hailed with enthusiasm.
The people there did not stop to inquire whether its
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_251' name='Page_251' href='#Page_251'>251</a></span>
aims were such as should control the acts of one
powerful nation toward its weaker neighbor, but gave
it unstinted support from the first. In Texas the war
spirit was fully aroused by the promise of meeting her
old enemy on more equal terms.
</p>

<p>
The war soon developed the larger issues we have
pointed out. So though sometimes called "a little
war," it is seen that the contest with Mexico was being
waged for a large stake.

<h4>
CONQUEST OF NEW MEXICO.
</h4>

<p>
While the heaviest fighting was going on in Old
Mexico, the Government easily took possession of
New Mexico and California, by means of expeditions
organized on the remote frontiers.
</p>

<p>
New Mexico was wanted for the emigration to the
Pacific. If we were to have California we must also
have the right of way to it. In the hands of the
Spaniards, New Mexico barred access to the Pacific so
completely that the oldest travelled route was scarcely
known to Americans at all, and but little used by the
Spaniards themselves.
</p>

<p>
If now we consult a map of the United States it is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_252' name='Page_252' href='#Page_252'>252</a></span>
seen that the thirty-fourth parallel crosses the Mississippi
at the mouth of the Arkansas, cuts New Mexico
in the middle, and reaches the Pacific near Los Angeles.
It was long the belief of statesmen that the great tide
of emigration must set along this line, because it had
the most temperate climate, was shorter, and would be
found freer from hardship than the route by way of
the South Pass. This view had set on foot the exploration
of the Arkansas and Red rivers. But if we except
the little that Pike and Long had gathered, almost
nothing was known about it. Yet the prevailing belief
gave New Mexico, as related to California, an exceptional
importance.
</p>

<p>
These considerations weighed for more than acquisition
of territory, though the notion that New Mexico
contained very rich silver-mines undoubtedly had force
in determining its conquest. Otherwise it was held to
be a poor country, with little arable land, mostly mountainous,
and scarcely fertile in the valleys, while in
consequence of its great elevation the winters were
severe.
</p>

<p>
Thus New Mexico seemed placed by Nature as a half-way house
may stand alone at the summit of a mountain
pass with deserts upon either side. It offered a place
for the refreshment of the nation's travellers. At best
it was only a thin wedge of semi-civilization driven
north into barbarism as far as Spanish power could
send it, but this force had spent itself long ago, and
New Mexico now lay a stumbling-block in the path of
progress, in contented isolation. Our Government determined
to remove the obstruction.
</p>

<p>
With this object General Kearney marched from Fort
Leavenworth in June, 1846, for Santa Fé, at the head
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_253' name='Page_253' href='#Page_253'>253</a></span>
of a force<a name='FA_202' id='FA_202' href='#FN_202' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> of which a battalion of Mormons formed
part. After subduing New Mexico, Kearney was to go
on to California, and with the help of naval forces
already sent there, for the purpose, conquer that country
also.
</p>

</div>

<p>
It is worth while to dwell a moment upon one feature
of this expedition, if only for its singularity. The
Mormons were to be paid off in California, were to
turn the sword into a ploughshare
and settle in the country,
and had therefore been
allowed to take their families
and property with them.
They were seen when setting
out on the march by Mr.
Parkman, who thus describes
them: "There was something
very striking in the
half-military, half-patriarchal
appearance of these armed
fanatics, thus on their way
with their wives and children
to found, it might be, a Mormon empire in California.
</p>

<p>
"In the morning the country was covered with mist.
We were always early risers, but before we were ready
the voices of men driving in the cattle sounded all
around us. As we passed above their camp, we saw
through the obscurity that the tents were falling, and
the ranks rapidly forming; and, mingled with the cries
of women and children, the rolling of the Mormon
drums and the clear blast of their trumpets sounded
through the mist.
</p>

<p>
"From that time to the journey's end, we met almost
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_254' name='Page_254' href='#Page_254'>254</a></span>
every day long trains of government wagons, laden
with stores for the troops, crawling at a snail's pace
towards Santa Fé."
</p>

<p>
General Kearney marched by the Upper Arkansas, to
Bent's Fort,<a name='FA_203' id='FA_203' href='#FN_203' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> and from Bent's Fort over the old trail
through El Moro and Las Vegas, San Miguel and Old
Pecos, without meeting the opposition he expected,
or at any time seeing any considerable
body of the enemy.
On the 18th of
August, as the sun
was setting, the
stars and stripes
were unfurled over
the palace of Santa
Fé, and New Mexico
was declared
annexed<a name='FA_204' id='FA_204' href='#FN_204' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> to the
United States.
Either the home
government thought New Mexico quite safe from
attack, or, having decided to reserve all its strength
for the main conflict, had left this province to its
fate.
</p>

<p>
After organizing a civil government, and appointing
Charles Bent of Bent's Fort, governor, General Kearney
broke up his camp at Santa Fé, Sept. 25. His force
was now divided. One part, under Colonel Doniphan,
was ordered to join General Wool in Chihuahua.
A second detachment was left to garrison Santa Fé,
while Kearney went on to California with the rest of
the troops. The people everywhere seemed disposed to
submit quietly, and as most of the pueblos soon proffered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_255' name='Page_255' href='#Page_255'>255</a></span>
their allegiance to the United States Government,
little fear of an outbreak<a name='FA_205' id='FA_205' href='#FN_205' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> was felt.
</p>

<p>
Before leaving the valley, a courier was met bearing
the news that California also had submitted to us
without striking a blow. This information decided
General Kearney to send back most of his remaining
force, while with a few soldiers only he continued
his march through what is now Arizona for the
Pacific.
</p>

<p>
Near his point of departure from the Rio Grande, a
deputation of the Apaches came to have a talk with the
general. These hereditary foes of the Spaniards were
lost in wonder at seeing the order and celerity with
which our cavalry obeyed the bugle-call of "boots and
saddles,"—the order to
mount for the march.
The pent-up wrath of
three hundred years
broke forth among them
in hot words. "You
have taken New Mexico,
and will soon take California,"
they said. "Go,
then, and take Chihuahua,
Durango, and Sonora.
You fight for land. We care nothing for land.
We fight for the laws of Montezuma and for food.
The Mexicans are rascals, and we will kill them
all!"
</p>

<p>
Leaving this force to make its slow way down the
Gila, and across the sandy desert of Lower California,
we will now inquire what had happened to wrest California
from Spanish rule without bloodshed.

<h4>
THE TAKING OF CALIFORNIA.
</h4>

<p>
The courier who had been stopped by General
Kearney was Kit Carson, Fremont's old guide. Carson<a name='FA_206' id='FA_206' href='#FN_206' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a>
was on his way to Washington with despatches from
Commodore Stockton and Captain Fremont.
</p>

<p>
A few words will explain how Fremont came to be
in California at so critical a time. While trying to
make his way back to the States, through the Sierras,
he had been forced to recross their snows into the Sacramento
Valley, and had descended this valley, which
was found uninhabited, save by Indians, to Sutter's
Fort,<a name='FA_207' id='FA_207' href='#FN_207' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> where means were furnished him to continue his
journey homeward.
</p>

<p>
Delighted with the country, he had made so favorable
a report of it that he was again sent out (1845) for the
purpose of finding the shortest route for a railroad to
the Pacific, and especially to the neighborhood of San
Francisco Bay.
</p>

<p>
When Fremont set out, war with Mexico was thought
to be near at hand. Our Government coveted California
for several reasons. For one thing, our whale-fishery
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_257' name='Page_257' href='#Page_257'>257</a></span>
in the Pacific had grown to be a great business,
in which twenty thousand sailors and two hundred
thousand tons of shipping were employed. This interest
therefore wanted California, because the port of San
Francisco was the only one in the North Pacific not
blocked up by a sand-bar, like
that which renders the mouth of
the Columbia so difficult of access.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, a considerable emigration<a name='FA_208' id='FA_208' href='#FN_208' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a>
had already found its
way into California, whose fine
climate and fertile soil these people
praised so much to their
friends at home, that many were
already on the road, and more
preparing to follow them. Unknown
to themselves they were
to be the founders of a new commonwealth.
And even at this
early day Government and people
were talking of a Pacific
railroad, as a thing of coming
necessity, and the more sanguine
believers in "manifest destiny"
thought as many as fifteen thousand
Americans would be settled in Oregon and California
during their lifetime. Thus we had important
commercial views touching California, and we were
throwing into it what might be considered in the light
of the vanguard of an army of occupation. We had
won Texas in this way, and would win Oregon too.
</p>

<div class="figright">
<a name="i-268" id="i-268"></a>
<img src="images/i-268.jpg" width="150" height="359" alt="" />
<p class="caption">BIG TREE.</p>
</div>

<p>
It became a prime object with President Polk to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_258' name='Page_258' href='#Page_258'>258</a></span>
secure California, peaceably if we could, forcibly if we
must. Mexico was first asked to sell it, but refused.
Our Government then began a secret negotiation through
the American consul<a name='FA_209' id='FA_209' href='#FN_209' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> at Monterey, which aimed to
bring about the voluntary secession of California from
the Mexican Republic altogether, and the setting-up
instead of an independent government there under our
protection. But if this plan failed—and it did not
succeed—every thing was made ready to take California
by force of arms.
</p>

<p>
There was also fear lest England might try to obtain
in California what she was about to lose in Oregon,
namely, a Pacific seaport. Her ships were in those
waters. Mexico owed England money, as we have
said. How far this fear was well founded, is not clear;
but that it was felt there can be no doubt, for we find
Mr. Buchanan, our Secretary of State, instructing our
consul at Monterey that "the United States would
vigorously interpose to prevent California becoming a
British or French colony."
</p>

<p>
In furtherance of these views our squadron in the
Pacific had orders to take possession of the chief ports
of the country, so soon as war should begin.
</p>

<p>
Fremont therefore started on his third expedition
across the continent well informed of the general policy
of the Government toward California. For the rest, his
work was to be done wholly on Mexican ground, which,
being taken with the other elements of the case, of itself
seems plainly foreshadowing the views of the Government.
</p>

<p>
On this journey, Fremont crossed from the head of
the Arkansas into Utah, and from the Utah Desert to
the Humboldt Mountains and River, both of which
he named at this time for the great German scientist.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_259' name='Page_259' href='#Page_259'>259</a></span>
From here he again struck the Sierra Nevada, which he
crossed, as before, into the Sacramento Valley.
</p>

<img src="images/i-270.jpg" width="400" height="342" alt="" />
<p class="caption">STATES AND TERRITORIES ACQUIRED FROM MEXICO.</p>
</div>

<p>
Upon reaching the vicinity of Monterey, Fremont
was ordered out of the country by the Mexican authorities.
Intrenching himself on a hill, back of Monterey,
he hoisted the American flag, and bade defiance to the
order. Finding the Mexicans would not attack him,
he marched northward up the Sacramento Valley as
far as Klamath Lake unmolested, save by Indians with
whom he had several combats.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_260' name='Page_260' href='#Page_260'>260</a></span>
</p>

<p>
At this place, Fremont was overtaken by a messenger
who had come across Mexico with despatches from the
Government. It is thought Fremont was unofficially
advised to make the most of any opportunity that
should present itself. At any rate, he seems to have
thought the time was come for him to drop his character
of explorer and turn his presence in California to
account. He therefore set out at once for Sutter's
Fort, where he could be near the American settlers,
who were living in the lower part of the valley or
about the Bay of San Francisco. Fremont thus became
the rallying-point for his countrymen in California, and
their protector.
</p>

<p class="caption">CALIFORNIA INDIANS AND TULE HUTS, SACRAMENTO VALLEY.</p>
</div>

<p>
This was in June, 1846. Rumors of war were now
flying thick and fast. The Californians were quarrelling
among themselves over questions then dividing the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_261' name='Page_261' href='#Page_261'>261</a></span>
Mexican nation. The American settlers were thrown
into more or less alarm by the threats made to drive
them from the country. We had ships-of-war at San
Francisco and Monterey, but their commanders hesitated
to act until it was known the two nations were
at war. The settlers put an end to all indecision by
raising the flag of revolt themselves. On the 14th
these settlers seized Sonoma, a military post lying to
the north of San Pablo Bay. They immediately proclaimed
California an independent republic. Upon this
Fremont put himself at their head. He marched first
to Sonoma, and next to the Presidio of San Francisco,
whose garrison fled at his approach. By these prompt
acts all the country lying north of the Bay of San
Francisco fell into the hands of the insurgents.
</p>

<p>
These events were followed by the raising of an
American flag over Monterey, July 7, by Commodore
Sloat. The same thing was done by his order at Yerba
Buena and Sonoma. As soon as he heard of it, Fremont
also hoisted the flag at Sutter's Fort. He then marched
for Monterey, where the ships Savannah, Congress,
Cyane, and Levant were lying with their guns commanding
the town. An English line-of-battle ship was
also anchored in the basin of Monterey, and another
at Yerba Buena. With whatever intentions they had
come, they had arrived just too late.
</p>

<p>
In this manner what is known as the Bear Flag Revolution,
from the settlers' having borne a bear on their
standard, began and ended with Fremont for its central
figure. Without him it would never have been possible.
But for him the conquest would not have come
when it did, but it would have come.
</p>

<p>
Commodore Stockton, an energetic officer who succeeded
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_262' name='Page_262' href='#Page_262'>262</a></span>
Sloat, now took active steps for putting down
all armed resistance to the United States. Fremont's
battalion,<a name='FA_210' id='FA_210' href='#FN_210' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> now mustered into the service of the United
States, but until then acting independently, was sent to
San Diego on board the Cyane. No resistance was
met with at San Diego. Fremont
then marched on Los
Angeles, the actual capital,
which he entered in company
with a force led by Commodore
Stockton from San Pedro, on
the coast. The Californians
nowhere made a stand, but fled
to the mountains rising behind
Monterey.
</p>

<p>
California having thus fallen
so easily into our hands, steps
were at once taken to quiet it.
Civil officers were appointed to
administer the government.
The inhabitants were promised
protection so long as they kept peace,
while, as if to clinch what had been
done already, numbers of emigrants
were coming down into the Sacramento
Valley from the north, and
coming to stay.
</p>

<p class="caption">EL CAPITAN, YOSEMITE.</p>
</div>

<p>
An insurrection in the south put an end to this state
of things. In a little time the interior country was
again overrun. While it was in progress, General
Kearney was heard from. After making one of the
longest marches on record, he had arrived near San
Pasqual, where the insurgents were found in some
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_263' name='Page_263' href='#Page_263'>263</a></span>
strength. A fight took place in which Kearney's overmatched
force was roughly handled, and for a time
hemmed in by foes. The Californians were themselves
in turn defeated at San Gabriel and the Mesa, and
meeting Fremont coming to attack them from Santa
Barbara, gave themselves up to him.
</p>

<p>
The war on the Pacific coast was thus ended, while
that on the Atlantic was still in progress. General
Taylor had taken Monterey, and later fought the battle
of Buena Vista, which was obstinately contested. A
second army under General Scott landed at Vera Cruz,
and, with the aid of the fleet, took the castle of San
Juan de Ulloa. This army then began its victorious
march for the City of Mexico, winning battles at Cerro
Gordo, Churubusco, Molino del Rey, and Chapultepec.
Having overcome all opposition, the capital was entered,
and the war ended Sept. 14, 1847.
</p>

<p>
By the treaty of peace, which followed (Feb. 2, 1848),
the United States acquired New Mexico and California,
for which fifteen millions were paid. Mexico also gave
up her claim to the territory east of the Rio Grande.
That river on the east, and the Gila on the west, now
formed the southern boundary of the United States,
from the Gulf of Mexico to the junction of the Gila
with the Colorado. From thence a straight line extended
it to the Pacific, so as to include the port of San
Diego.

Sutter was by birth a Swiss. He came
from Missouri to California in 1838-39,
and made the first settlement in the valley
on a tract granted him by the Mexican
Government in consideration of his
keeping the Indians in check. To this
end he built a fort, and armed it with
guns bought of the abandoned Russian
Colony at Bodega. The fort was a quadrangular
structure, built of adobe,
mounting twelve guns, and capable of
containing a thousand men, though Fremont
found in it but thirty whites, and
forty Indians whom Sutter had domesticated.
It stood on the banks of a creek
running to the American River. Vessels
ascended to within two miles of it.
Fremont found in Sutter's Fort a base
ready prepared for his operations against
the Californians. Though holding a
Mexican commission, Sutter soon joined
the American party himself. The fort is
perhaps best known in connection with
the discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill,
now Coloma, fifty miles above it. Sutter
lived here independently, raising large
crops and herds with Indian laborers.
His extensive grant was called New
Helvetia, and included the site of Sacramento
City. Except this, the Spaniards

<h4>
THE MORMONS IN UTAH.
</h4>

<p>
The Mormons, or Latter Day Saints<a name='FA_211' id='FA_211' href='#FN_211' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> as they prefer
to call themselves, have been mentioned in a former
chapter. They are a religious community whose teachings
differ widely from those of any other Christian
body in the land. For one thing, they allow polygamy,<a name='FA_212' id='FA_212' href='#FN_212' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a>
which is not only repugnant to the moral sense of
the great body of Christian people, but to the laws as
well.
</p>

<p>
Driven from Missouri (1838), and from Illinois ten
years later, their leaders cast about for some place of
refuge, so remote that persecution could not reach
them, and where they might practise their religious
forms freely. Like most religious sects the Mormons
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_265' name='Page_265' href='#Page_265'>265</a></span>
seemed to thrive upon persecution, for their numbers
were constantly increasing under it.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">SALT LAKE CITY AND TABERNACLE.</p>
</div>

<p>
It was at this time that Fremont's description of the
region about the Great Salt Lake arrested the attention
of Brigham Young, the Mormon patriarch. Fremont
had said the valley of Bear River, a tributary of this
lake, made "a natural resting and recruiting station
for travellers." Its bottoms were extensive, water
excellent, timber sufficient, and soil well adapted to
the grains and grasses suited to so elevated a region.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_266' name='Page_266' href='#Page_266'>266</a></span>
The great lake would furnish exhaustless supplies of
salt. And he gave it as his opinion, that cattle and
horses would thrive where grass and salt were so
abundantly provided by nature. With these advantages
he recommended it for civilized settlement.
</p>

<p>
Upon this, the Mormons, who were farmers and
graziers, decided to form themselves in one great caravan,
and travel to this Great Salt Lake. They started
out with one hundred and forty-seven people and seventy-three
wagons. On the 24th of July, 1847, as the
caravan slowly wound down the Wasatch Mountains,
the exiles saw the plain of their New Jerusalem stretching
out before them, but when they reached it they
found nothing growing upon it but sage-bushes.
</p>

<p>
They however laid out their city<a name='FA_213' id='FA_213' href='#FN_213' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> at the foot of the
hills, on a river which, as it runs from Utah Lake to
Salt Lake, intercepts the streams coming down the
eastern hills. The Mormons called this river the Jordan,
because of some fancied resemblance to the river
of Palestine.
</p>

<p>
Finding all so barren about them, these people took
counsel of the experience of their neighbors, the Pueblo
Indians, who for want of wood build their houses of
adobe, and for want of rain raise crops by watering
them artificially. Thus Salt Lake soon grew out of an
arid plain to be a city of gardens and running streams.
</p>

<p>
In setting forth the advantages of the Utah Basin,
Fremont had described a portion of the neighbor republic
of Mexico, with which we were then at peace, and
in making it their home the Mormons had been moved
by a desire to go outside the limits of the United
States, but were strangely brought back within them
again when California was ceded to us.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_267' name='Page_267' href='#Page_267'>267</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Though shut out from the world, this strange colony
steadily grew in strength and numbers. The Mormon
Church had sent out its missionaries to make converts
in other lands, for in the Union its doctrines were
detested, and the community itself looked upon as
little better than outcasts. So the increase was mostly
from this source. Hence it was natural that the Mormon
body should have in it less of the spirit of national
feeling than other communities, and grow more and
more away from the Union by reason of its isolation
and the teachings of its rulers.
</p>

<p>
These teachings were embodied in a hierarchy, or, in
other words, Church and State were one with the Church
above the civil authority. The bishops, chief priests,
and elders were the actual rulers, who both made and
gave the law, and each member of the society gave a
tenth of his living to the support of the Church. All
who did not conform to the Mormon faith were denied
any share in civil affairs. Thus the Mormons had set
up in Utah<a name='FA_214' id='FA_214' href='#FN_214' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> a little republic of their own, which, in
effect, excluded other citizens of the Union from a full
share in its privileges. Though a republic in name it
was a despotism at the root. In short, the Mormons
had gone to Utah to found a society for themselves
alone, in which none but their own people should find
a welcome.
</p>

<p>
It followed that the Mormon state was looked upon
as an element of danger, rather than strength, to the
Union, for the place where it was founded was a natural
stronghold from which the authority of the nation
might be set at defiance, as soon happened.
</p>

<p>
Flourishing only by reason of their isolation, the
Mormons looked with little favor upon the passing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_268' name='Page_268' href='#Page_268'>268</a></span>
emigration, though they drew much benefit from it.
They could sell their cattle, grain, horses and other
supplies to the emigrants at high prices, but the steady
march of these people toward the west threatened the
security they wished to enjoy apart from the world.
Though always hostile to the great westward movement,
and sometimes resorting to violence to stay it, the
Mormons have been made to contribute to its success,
not indeed as free agents, but as instruments in the
hands of destiny. Formidable only in their seclusion,
they have presented the anomaly of a handful of people
throwing themselves before the wheels of progress.
Though no longer formidable, they have done a notable
work in making productive what was before considered
an uninhabitable desert.

<p>
What El Dorado<a name='FA_215' id='FA_215' href='#FN_215' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> had been to the active imaginings
of De Soto's Spaniards, was now to become a
reality that would startle the world from its long forgetfulness.
The world believed they had been chasing
a phantom which lured them to their death. One seeks
in vain to know why Nature at last revealed the secret
she had so long kept hid from those who had sought
but not found, to disclose it to others who had found
without seeking.
</p>

<p>
The war was scarcely ended<a name='FA_216' id='FA_216' href='#FN_216' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> which gave us California,
when a scene took place there of far-reaching
moment to mankind. Words can hardly describe it.
For a time it seemed the overturning of all laws governing
the acquisition and distribution of wealth, if it
were not to put the common laborer on a level with the
millionaire, and so revolutionize society itself. When
we consider what has followed in its train, the story
itself seems tame indeed.

<p class="caption">SUTTER'S MILL.</p>
</div>

<p>
Captain Sutter had been having a saw-mill built for
him fifty miles above his fort, on the south fork of the
American River, which is here a swift mountain stream.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_272' name='Page_272' href='#Page_272'>272</a></span>
One evening, when all within the fort wore its usual
quiet, a horseman rode up in hot haste, and asked to
see Sutter alone. This was James W. Marshall, one of
Sutter's men, who had charge of the mill above. Seeing
by his manner that something unusual was the
matter, Sutter led the way into his private room, and
turned the key
in the lock.
With much
show of mystery,
Marshall
then handed his employer a packet, which being opened,
was found to contain a handful of yellow metal, in flakes
or kernels, which he said he had taken from the mill-race,
and asserted to be gold. By the light of a candle
the two men bent over the little heap of shining particles
in eager scrutiny. Sutter would not believe it was gold.
Marshall was sure it could be nothing else. Aquafortis
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_273' name='Page_273' href='#Page_273'>273</a></span>
was then tried without effect. The metal was next
weighed with silver, in water. All doubt was removed.
It was indeed gold, yellow gold, that Marshall had found.
</p>

<p>
His story, briefly told, was to this effect. They had
started the mill, when the tail-race was found too small
to carry off the water. In order to deepen it the whole
head of water was then let into the race, thus washing
it out to the required depth. It was while looking at
the work the water had done, that Marshall saw many
shining particles lodged in crevices of the rocks, or
among the dirt the water had carried down before it.
All at once it flashed upon him that this might be gold.
Gathering up what he could without risk of detection,
he had started off for the fort without making his
discovery known to any one.
</p>

<p>
Sutter saw his happy pastoral life of the past on the
point of vanishing. He made an idle effort to keep the
discovery secret, at least till he could set his house in
order. It was soon known in the household and at the
mill. From this little mountain nook it was borne on
the wings of the wind to the sea-coast, and from the
sea-coast to the four quarters of the globe.
</p>

<p>
Captain Sutter's men<a name='FA_217' id='FA_217' href='#FN_217' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> deserted him in a body. The
American settlers and Indians of the neighborhood
next caught the infection. Gold was quickly found at
a point midway between Sutter's Fort and Mill, called
the Mormon Diggings,<a name='FA_218' id='FA_218' href='#FN_218' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> on Feather River, and in the
gulches above the mill site. From these districts the first
miners began to straggle down to San Francisco with
pouches of gold-dust in their possession. Men who had
hardly known what it was to have a dollar of their own
suddenly lived
</p>

<p class="center">
"Like an emperor in their expense."
</p>
<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_274' name='Page_274' href='#Page_274'>274</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The effect was magical. Within a short three
months most of the houses in San Francisco and Monterey
were shut up. Blacksmiths left their anvils, carpenters
their benches, sailors their ships. Soldiers were
every day deserting from the garrisons of San Francisco,
Sonoma, and Monterey.
The two
newspapers<a name='FA_219' id='FA_219' href='#FN_219' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> then
printed in the country
suspended their
issue indefinitely.
Everybody was off
for the mines, and
nothing else was
talked of but gold.

<p class="caption">TWO MINERS.</p>
</div>

<p>
Consul Larkin
thus describes the
scene at the Mormon
Diggings in
June, 1848: "At
my camping-place
I found forty or
fifty tents, mostly
occupied by Americans,
strewn about
the hillsides next
the river. I spent
two nights in company with eight Americans, two of
whom were sailors, two carpenters, one a clerk, and
three common laborers. With two machines called
cradles, these men made fifty dollars each per day. Another
miner had washed out, with a common tin pan,
gold to the value of eighty-two dollars in a single day."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_275' name='Page_275' href='#Page_275'>275</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Mr. Larkin thought there were then about one thousand
people, mostly foreigners, actually working in the
mines, whose daily gains would amount to at least ten
thousand dollars. And he even ventured to hint that
at this rate gold enough would be produced in a single
year to repay what California had cost the nation.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Mason, the military governor, adds what he
saw while making a tour of inspection to the new
placers: "Along the whole route mills were lying idle,
fields of wheat were open to cattle and horses, houses
vacant, and farms going to waste. At Sutter's there
was more life and business. Launches were discharging
their cargoes at the river, and carts were hauling
goods to the fort, where were already established several
stores, a hotel, etc. Captain Sutter had only two
mechanics in his employ, whom he was then paying ten
dollars a day. Merchants pay him a monthly rent of
one hundred dollars per room; and while I was there a
two-story house in the fort was rented as a hotel for
five hundred dollars a month."

<p>
Meanwhile the area of the gold-fields was being
rapidly enlarged on all sides by new discoveries. Each
day had its story of the finding of some richer placer
for which a general rush was made. As time wore on,
gold was found in all the streams which cut their way
through the foothills of the great Sierra.<a name='FA_221' id='FA_221' href='#FN_221' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> By midsummer
four thousand people, half of whom were Indians,
were washing for gold as if it had been the only employment
of their lives.
</p>

<p>
By this time too the first guarded statements made
about the extent and richness of the gold-fields gave place
to predictions
as bold as they
were hard to
believe. For
instance, Governor
Mason,
who had been
over-cautious
at first, soon
had no hesitation
in saying
that there was more gold in the country than would
pay the cost of the war a hundred times over.

It is true that flour was worth fifty dollars a barrel,
at the mines, and a common spade ten dollars, but
when even the poor and degraded Indians of the
rancherias<a name='FA_222' id='FA_222' href='#FN_222' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> could afford the luxuries of life, the cost
of necessaries was of little account to men who thought
four golden ounces only a fair return for a day's labor.

</p>

<p>
This is the story of only a few short months,—the
preface, as one might say, to the larger history. It
was yet too soon for the discovery to be known in the
United States, but the time was drawing near when it
would be the one all-engrossing topic in every hamlet
from Maine to Florida.
Meanwhile it spread to
all the shores and isles
of the Pacific. Dark-visaged
Kanakas from
the Sandwich Islands,
swarthy Peruvians and
Chilenos, added their
thousands to the already
composite character of
the population of the
land of gold. From the
Russian Possessions in
the north, from the Sandwich
Islands in the midst
of the Pacific, the wondrous
tale was speeding
on to China and the
Australian Isles. Then
with the autumnal rains
the first chapter of this history of marvels was closed
for a brief season.

<p>
Authentic reports of the gold discovery first appeared
in the public prints of the Atlantic States in the
autumn. In December, President Polk gave Governor
Mason's and Consul Larkin's reports to the country.
From these sources the story was taken up and multiplied
through the myriad channels of public and private
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_278' name='Page_278' href='#Page_278'>278</a></span>
intelligence, until the name of California became a
household word throughout all the length and breadth
of the land. Talismanic word! It was soon to entice
a million men from their homes to seek their fortunes
among the gulches of the wild Sierra.
</p>

<p>
Rarely in the history of the world has society been
so deeply stirred to its centre. It was like an electric
shock that is felt throughout the whole social organization.
First there was the numbness of wonder, then
the fever of unwonted excitement. How to get to
this land of gold, was now the one absorbing question
of the hour. Near a thousand leagues of barren plains
and desert mountains lay between it and the settled
frontier. These could only be crossed after grass had
grown in the spring. A still longer ocean journey
must be made by crossing the Isthmus of Darien, over
the trail struck out by the viceroys when Spain held the
keys of the East; or, if the voyage were to be made
round Cape Horn, the distance would be more than
quadrupled. But the thought of these vast distances
to be traversed seemed only to add to the general impatience
to surmount them. The temper of the public
mind was such that it would bear any thing but delay.
Soon ships were fitting out in every port<a name='FA_223' id='FA_223' href='#FN_223' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> of the Union
for Tampico or Vera Cruz, for Chagres, and for the
long voyage round Cape Horn. In the seaports nothing
was heard but the note of preparation. On the
frontier caravans were everywhere forming to go forward
with the appearance of the first blade of grass
above ground. "Ho for California!" was the cry
borne on every breeze that wafted ship after ship out
over the wide ocean with her little colony of gold-seekers.
"Ho for California!" was the watchword of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_279' name='Page_279' href='#Page_279'>279</a></span>
those who were braving the perils of a winter journey
across the Sierras. And "California!" was still the
answer of other bands that were wending their way
across the Cordilleras, in paths first traced by Cortez
and his comrades, to Acapulco, San Blas or Mazatlan
on the Pacific. All roads seemed leading to the
Golden Gate. El Dorado was found at last.

<h4>
THE CALIFORNIA PIONEERS.
</h4>

<p>
Although we have seen much doing there in the
previous year, and the earliest comers were the true
pioneers, the great rush to the gold region took place
in 1849, upon the first news being spread throughout
the States. It is therefore from that year that the history
of the gold fever is usually dated.
</p>

<p>
So great was the demand for shipping, that even old
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_280' name='Page_280' href='#Page_280'>280</a></span>
whale-ships were fitted up to carry three or four hundred
passengers round Cape Horn. Even these were
quickly crowded with emigrants. But ere long the demand
for vessels that would show greater speed gave
rise to new models in ship-building; and to this cause
we owe the fast clipper ships which sometimes sailed
from New York to San Francisco in eighty-seven days.
</p>

<p>
At first it was much the fashion
for men to go in companies formed
in their own neighborhoods. Those
who could not go themselves would
club together and send a substitute,
as men may own shares in a ship
or a machine, the substitute being
allowed to keep a certain share of
the profits of his own labor.
</p>

<p class="caption">A FATHER.</p>
</div>

<p>
Then, again, a novel appearance
was given to the streets of our seaport
towns by the daily presence in
them of men dressed in red woollen
shirts, slouch hats, and cowhide
boots,—men wearing pistols and
dirks, or carrying rifles,—whom
it was not easy to know for peaceful
citizens just turned out of their farms or workshops
or counting-houses. Nor was the emigration confined
to the bone and sinew of society only. Men of every
walk in life were drawn into it. A scholar might have
a day-laborer for his companion. Larkin has told us
how this worked in the mines. The one purpose to dig
for gold quickly put all on an equal footing, for in
making labor the sole means of wealth, as in the beginning
it was, the common laborer had become the peer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_281' name='Page_281' href='#Page_281'>281</a></span>
of the most learned scholar in the land. Hence every
ship and every caravan carried its little republic of
equality. And hence society seemed going back into
its original elements, as if gold were the magnet attracting
all else to itself.
</p>

<p class="caption">MOUNT SHASTA.</p>
</div>

<p>
The sailing of many ships, full freighted with eager
gold-seekers, was followed in the early spring by the
march of thousands across the plains. Like colonies
of migratory ants the long line of wagons crept along
the roads leading to the South Pass and Rio Grande.
At Salt Lake City, which we have just seen founded,
the weary emigrants tarried a while to recruit their
failing animals for the dreaded passage of the desert;
then to the road again to struggle ever on through the
parched valleys, where their gaunt beasts died of thirst,
or up the granite sides
of the Sierras, where
they dropped from exhaustion,
till the Sacramento
Valley was
reached at last, and
Shasta Peak burst on
their enraptured sight.
Hundreds perished by
the way, and long after
the march for gold in 1849 might be traced by the
abandoned wagons or dead animals that strewed its
path.
</p>

<p>
Many reached Panama by way of the Chagres River,
whose course led up to the mountain chain dividing the
waters of the Atlantic from those of the Pacific. Day
by day a motley fleet of dug-out canoes might have
been seen toiling with pole and oar against the swift
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_282' name='Page_282' href='#Page_282'>282</a></span>
current of this mountain stream. At the head of boat
navigation, in an open spot, under the high mountains,
a few cocoanut palms lifted tufts of graceful foliage
above a clump of miserable huts, whose owners were
of mixed Spanish and Indian blood. This was on the
route the Spaniards had discovered in 1513. This was
Gorgona.
</p>

<img src="images/i-293.jpg" width="200" height="205" alt="" />
<p class="caption">ON THE OREGON TRAIL.</p>
</div>

<p>
Taking mules at Gorgona the emigrants crossed the
mountains to the Pacific, which they here closely approach.
At the ancient
city of Panama, interesting
only as a specimen
of that older civilization
which had run
its course, several thousand
Americans<a name='FA_224' id='FA_224' href='#FN_224' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> were
soon waiting for vessels
to take them on
to California. Every
crazy hulk that would
float had been taken
up by earlier comers.
So these people had to stay at Panama through the
sickly season, though the deadly fever of the country
was daily thinning their ranks of the bravest and best.
Thus months of weary waiting must pass before these
people could set foot in the land of gold.
</p>

<p>
When they did reach it<a name='FA_225' id='FA_225' href='#FN_225' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> they found San Francisco<a name='FA_226' id='FA_226' href='#FN_226' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a>
a city of tents and shanties scattered about a group
of barren, wind-swept sand-hills. In the basin below,
formed by the curving shore, a fleet of deserted ships
rode at anchor. Farther off rose the little island of
Yerba Buena,<a name='FA_227' id='FA_227' href='#FN_227' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> and still farther, beyond the leagues of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_283' name='Page_283' href='#Page_283'>283</a></span>
glittering water, the rugged wall of the Coast Range
grandly enclosed the bay in its encircling arm.

<p>
To this picture now add the hurry and confusion
which the beach showed at all hours of the day, and
we shall get a rapid glimpse at the humble beginnings
of the destined mart of the Pacific. Those tents on
the beach were the warehouses of the future metropolis;
those on the hills were the abodes of its wealthiest
citizens.
</p>

<p>
Should we follow the swarm of boats seen every
hour pushing off from the beach for the mines, they
would lead us to the two great inland waterways of
the country. On the spot where Sutter had made his
landing-place another city had sprung into being. This
was Sacramento. On the San Joaquin, where Weber
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_284' name='Page_284' href='#Page_284'>284</a></span>
had made a home in 1844, Stockton was growing up.
These were the two great depots for the mines north
and south.

</div>

<p>
By the beginning of the new year (1849) the population
of California had run up to twenty-five thousand.
The winter months, or, as we should say of this region,
the rainy season, everywhere brought great suffering to
the badly-housed and ill-fed emigrants, many of whom
reached the mines in a state
of destitution. There were
many things even gold could
not buy or wealth command.
Men who had both were glad
to get acorns to live on.
Many died this first winter.
With the coming of spring
the depleted ranks were more than filled by new arrivals,
and when January came round again the pioneers of
1849 were a hundred thousand.

<h4>
CALIFORNIA A FREE STATE.
</h4>

<p>
The United States did not set up a Territorial government
in California at once, but put military governors
over it, who continued the old laws of Mexico in force.
What these were, only the native people could know.
They had not yet been translated into English. Many,
indeed, derided the idea of being governed by laws
made for Spaniards. Instead, then, of being clothed
with power to enact laws suited to the new and strange
conditions growing out of the gold discovery, with
society unformed, or breaking to pieces about them,
the people of California found themselves living almost
without law, except such as imperative need compelled
them to make and enforce for themselves. This state
of things could have but one result among a people
hastily thrown together from all parts of the earth,
most of whom were law-abiding, but many the outcasts
of society. It led to confusion, lawlessness, and crime.
In the annals of the State it is usually called the interregnum,
from the Latin word signifying a suspension
of the regular functions of government.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, as the actual laws remained either mostly
unknown, or were held in little esteem, the people conformed
to them only so far as to give the officers or
courts they chose among themselves Spanish names.
They everywhere took the law into their own hands,
establishing such local laws, or usages having the force
of laws, as their situation would seem to give warrant
for.
</p>

<p>
Thus, the miners determined for themselves how much
room each man should have to dig in; and they established
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_286' name='Page_286' href='#Page_286'>286</a></span>
in their camps rude codes of justice by which
the worst crimes usually met with prompt punishment.
If, for instance, a man committed murder, he would
be tried on the
spot by a miners'
court, hastily
summoned
for the purpose.
Trials of this
sort were generally
conducted
in an
orderly manner,
and seldom
failed of doing justice, but they were always felt to
be a departure from the usages of civilized people, and
in so far a going-back toward barbarism.

Governor Riley, in 1849, called the people to meet in
convention for the forming of a State government. The
delegates accordingly assembled in September at Monterey.
They framed a constitution, on the plan of the
free States, prohibiting slavery; for as labor was to be
the corner-stone of the State, the men
of 1849 would not degrade free labor
by competition with slave-labor.
In November the
constitution was ratified
by the people; and in December
the officers elected
under it met at San José
to fully organize the State
government.

</div>

<p>
The petition of California
to be a free State was
strongly resisted by the
Southern men in Congress,
who had hoped it would
come in as a slave
State. Once again
it brought up the
whole subject of
slavery extension.
Eventually the
struggle gave rise
to another compromise by which California came in as
a free State (1850), the slave-trade was abolished in the
District of Columbia, and the Fugitive Slave Law passed,
mainly by the efforts of Henry Clay. The execution of
the last-named law roused the indignation of the North
as nothing had ever yet done. Resistance to slavery
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_288' name='Page_288' href='#Page_288'>288</a></span>
extension was now become the dominant question there
in politics, in literature, and in the pulpit. The doctrine
that the people of a territory alone should have
the right to decide whether they would have slavery
or not had been urged with much force by Senator
Douglas in the case of California; and thus popular
sovereignty, as it was called, now first brought together
the moderate partisans of slavery, those indifferent to
its extension, and those who believed such a settlement
as Mr. Douglas proposed would lift the question out
of party agitation, and so put a stop to the threats of
secession, which was the bugbear of all who loved the
Union.
</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h4>
ARIZONA.
</h4>

<p>
A dispute having arisen with Mexico about the
boundary the war had established, President Pierce
settled it by buying the territory in question (1853)
for ten millions of dollars. General James Gadsden
negotiated its transfer, and for him it was called the
Gadsden Purchase. The United States thus acquired
the strip of country lying between the Gila River and
the present southern boundary of Arizona. Prior to
its purchase it had formed part of the Mexican State
of Sonora. Mr. Gadsden exerted himself to secure
with it the port of Guaymas on the Gulf of California,
but was not sustained by Congress in his effort to do so.
</p>

<p>
At the period of its cession to us Arizona was practically
unknown except to hunters and trappers or to the
few who had read the accounts of the early Spanish
explorers. Mr. Gadsden was ridiculed for making the
purchase, and Congress censured for squandering the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_289' name='Page_289' href='#Page_289'>289</a></span>
people's money upon an arid waste destitute of sufficient
wood and water to sustain a population of civilized
beings. The failure of the Spaniards to found any
considerable settlements was dwelt upon. Stories of
mines of fabulous wealth that Arizona held locked up
in her mountains had indeed come down from a remote
time, and were more or less current abroad, but few
believed in them, or could see any compensating advantage
to accrue to us for the millions Congress had
spent. Government, however, caused the territory
immediately to be surveyed with the view of settling
the question whether we had or had not been cheated
in making the purchase.

<h3>
II.
<br />
THE CONTEST FOR FREE SOIL.
</h3>

<hr />

<h4>
THE KANSAS-NEBRASKA STRUGGLE.
</h4>

<p>
At the period now reached by our story the political
sense of the people, in all things touching the
national life, was represented by the Whig and Democratic
parties. There was yet another body formed to
prevent the coming in of any more slave States, and
therefore called the Free-Soil party. This last party
had only come into being since the war with Mexico,
and was not yet strong enough to successfully cope with
the older ones for control in national affairs; but it was
growing stronger every day.
</p>

<p>
Neither of the two great parties was divided by
geographical lines. Both called themselves national
parties, but since the extension of slavery was become
the vital question of the hour, the Whig party was
losing ground to the Free-Soil party, which indeed
mostly grew up from the defection of those Whigs who
determined henceforth to stand with the opponents of
slavery until that question should be settled forever.
So while the Whig party was strongest in the free
States, it was beginning to go to pieces because it no
longer represented the growing feeling against slavery
in those States, though it was still led by able statesmen
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_291' name='Page_291' href='#Page_291'>291</a></span>
like Daniel Webster, whom the country had
always looked to in the past for safe counsel and guidance
through all the perils of party strife.
</p>

<p>
The Democratic party, on the contrary, being most
numerous in the slaveholding States, was more firmly
united than ever by the agitation about slavery, which
their great leader, Calhoun, had told them could only
be maintained by being
extended, and could only
be extended by becoming
aggressive.
</p>

<div class="figright">

<img src="images/i-302.jpg" width="200" height="261" alt="" />
<p class="caption">STEPHEN A. DOUGLAS.</p>
</div>

<p>
Here, then, we have the
political situation after
the admission of California,
in a nutshell. In
the South the Democratic
party stood solid and defiant
in support of slavery
extension; in the
North it favored popular
sovereignty, as defined
by Mr. Douglas. The
Free-Soil party declared
its purpose to oppose the making of any more slave
States, and under the lead of Sumner of Massachusetts,
Chase of Ohio, and Seward of New York, prepared
to make head against its formidable opponents.
The Whigs were now looked upon as the party of vacillation,
weakness, and compromise. Though in nominal
opposition to the Democrats, its leadership was no
longer trusted, because it was felt to have surrendered
the one principle<a name='FA_228' id='FA_228' href='#FN_228' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> on which the coming struggle inevitably
would turn.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_292' name='Page_292' href='#Page_292'>292</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The Democratic party succeeded in electing Franklin
Pierce<a name='FA_229' id='FA_229' href='#FN_229' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> to the Presidency, for the term running from
1853 to 1857.
</p>

<p>
His administration is chiefly memorable for the passage
of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, by which two new
Territories were formed of the Louisiana Purchase, and
thrown open to settlement. In framing this Act its
authors left it to the people to choose for themselves
whether they would have slavery or not, as Douglas
urged they should; and in order that they might do so,
the compromise of 1820 was set aside. This measure
was largely the work of Mr. Douglas, who, arguing that
the people are sovereigns, viewed a reference of the
slavery question back to them, as the only true way of
settling the agitation about it. It had a certain fair-play
look that won many to its support in the North.
In this form Congress passed the Act, May 30, 1854.
</p>

<p>
To repeal the Missouri Compromise, was held by many
at the North and some at the South,<a name='FA_230' id='FA_230' href='#FN_230' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> to be a violation
of the pledge so sacredly made to the whole people,
not to admit slavery north of 36° 30´. We shall see
what it led to.
</p>

<p>
Let us look first at the new Territories as the organic
Act found them. From the Missouri on the east, they
reached to the Rocky Mountains on the west. They
contained the most fertile lands of the public domain.
The great thoroughfares to Oregon, California, and
New Mexico, traversed them in their whole length, so
making it clear, even at this early day, that the great
movement of the people from east to west must be
along the lines of these thoroughfares, strewing its
pathway with populous cities and towns as it went.
</p>

<p>
Already we have led the explorers through this magnificent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_293' name='Page_293' href='#Page_293'>293</a></span>
land. Through them much knowledge had
been gained of its natural features, its fine climate, and
of the unequalled fecundity of its soil. The West was
its neighbor and knew most about it. The East knew it
only through the accounts of Pike, Long, and Fremont,
from the reports of emigrants, or in the stories of travel
written by Irving, Latrobe and others, all of which
gave it a kind of romantic interest with their readers.
</p>

<p>
Upon the virgin soil of Kansas the fragments of
many of the one-time powerful red nations of the East
had been colonized. Here, at last, we meet again the
Wyandots of Lake Huron,<a name='FA_231' id='FA_231' href='#FN_231' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> the Delawares of Pennsylvania,
the Sacs and Foxes, Ottawas, Pottawatomies,
Shawnees, Kickapoos, Piankeshaws and other warlike
peoples whose race as nations had been run. To this
point they had at length been rolled back by the ever-advancing
tide of white emigration. They probably
far outnumbered the original owners of the soil,—the
Missouris, Kansas, Otoes, Pawnees, Osages,—and all
maintained their tribal organization unimpaired within
the limits Government had set for them. Here these
wrecks of once powerful peoples peacefully lived on
the bounty of the nation which had told them Kansas
was to be their permanent home.
</p>

<p>
Among most of these tribes missions and schools had
been planted by various religious denominations. One
of the richest and seemingly most prosperous ones was
that founded by the Methodists<a name='FA_232' id='FA_232' href='#FN_232' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> among the Shawnees,
who were half-civilized, and also held a few slaves.
</p>

<p>
To protect its emigrants who were constantly passing
over the great routes toward the Pacific, Government

chief branches of the Kansas, and Fort Kearney on the
Platte. Fort Scott was also founded in the south, on
the road leading to the Indian Territory.
</p>

<p>
Set against these new Territories were two States,—one
slave and the other free. It was thought that
Kansas would mostly take her settlers from Missouri,
and so easily be a slave State, while Nebraska in a like
manner would become a free State through the influence
of Iowa, its neighbor. Moreover the soil and
climate of Kansas were thought favorable to the employment
of slave labor, while Nebraska was considered
to lie north of the line beyond which such labor could
be made profitable. Hence it was to Kansas that the
efforts of those favoring slavery were turned; and as
the best part of it was occupied by Indians, their removal
or restricting within smaller tracts was provided
for, so making way for the coming settlement.

<h4>
KANSAS THE BATTLE-GROUND.
</h4>

<p>
When Congress decreed that freedom and slavery
should compete for control in Kansas, the decision
reminds us of the judgement given by the wise king of
history, who, having to decide which of two mothers a
child belonged to, ordered one of his guards to cut it in
two with his sword, and give the half to each claimant.
</p>

<p>
In this contest Congress and the President stood with
the South. The law-making power had first removed
every restriction to making Kansas a slave State, and
now the executive branch was to appoint governors<a name='FA_234' id='FA_234' href='#FN_234' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a>
over the people who should go there to live, and give
orders to the military commanders to aid them when
called upon to do so.
</p>

<p>
There was another very potent means working to the
same end, which in the hands of lawless men proved a
serious obstacle to the peaceful going-in of settlers from
the free States. The great avenue of travel into the
disputed territory was the Missouri River, whose banks
were already lined with a population holding many
slaves, and therefore easily aroused to active enmity by
the fear that the planting of a free State next their
border would cause their negroes to run away, and so
deprive them of their property. Moreover, as we have
already said, the Missourians had confidently looked
upon Kansas as theirs whenever it should be opened to
settlement, and could not bear the thought of having it
snatched from them by a people whose politics they
detested, and whose presence they feared.
</p>

<p>
Under these conditions the movement of settlers into
Kansas began at the North and South. It was no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_296' name='Page_296' href='#Page_296'>296</a></span>
peaceful march of peaceful citizens under the protecting
hand of the nation, but was turned by sectional
rivalry into a political crusade. Public meetings were
held all over the North and South to encourage the
going of the adventurous young men of both sections,
as in time of war. Sectional passions were aroused and
inflamed. Large sums were raised in the churches to
arm these emigrants for the conflict which it was clear
must take place sooner or later. So the war of the
sections that
so long had
threatened the
national peace
was begun at
last. Congress
had left the
question to the
people to settle,
less in the
spirit of statesmanship
than
as a way out of
the difficulty;
and the people, seeing that its peaceful settlement was
impossible, were getting ready to fight it out, not with
the ballot as Douglas believed they would, but as men
who are convinced that force, and force only, can decide
the justice of their cause.

</div>

<p>
Missourians began the settlement of Kansas. June,
1854, Leavenworth<a name='FA_235' id='FA_235' href='#FN_235' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> was laid out two miles below the
fort of that name. Another town was also begun
twenty-five miles farther up the Missouri, and named
for Senator Atchison<a name='FA_236' id='FA_236' href='#FN_236' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> of Missouri. These two, with St.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_297' name='Page_297' href='#Page_297'>297</a></span>
Joseph on the north and Kansas City on the south, not
only controlled all the river-front of Kansas, but the
roads leading into it as well, as St. Joseph and Kansas
City were the established starting-points for crossing
the plains, from which the great overland routes
diverged. Missouri settlers also shortly began a third
town, in the Kansas Valley, to which they gave the
name of Lecompton,<a name='FA_237' id='FA_237' href='#FN_237' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> and soon
made it the capital of the Territory.
</p>

<p>
Thus the North entered the
conflict to obtain control of
Kansas under every disadvantage
which remoteness, prior
occupation, or unyielding determination
to exclude all who
did not favor slavery, could
bring into it.
</p>

<p>
New England was the focus
of anti-slavery thought and
action, to which the rest of the North undoubtedly
looked for leadership. It was, therefore, in New England
that active steps for throwing free-State settlers
into Kansas first originated. This was effected through
an association known as the New-England Emigrant
Aid Company,<a name='FA_238' id='FA_238' href='#FN_238' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> which was the parent or forerunner of
many similar ones subsequently organized throughout
the free States. The New-England Company acted
with much method. It formed little colonies which
were put under competent leaders, were furnished with
farming-tools, and even took out saw-mills for the
making of new settlements. Some colonists took their
families along with them, but most of the first comers
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_298' name='Page_298' href='#Page_298'>298</a></span>
were single men whom the desire to see Kansas a free
State, rather than a thoughtless spirit of adventure,
took from the orderly communities of the Far East. To
this work they confidently went forth accompanied
by the prayers and good wishes of their friends and
neighbors, though as little used to the rude encounter
with border men and border life as
the two kinds of civilization each presented
in itself were removed one from the other.

Topeka, Manhattan, and Wabaunsee. Later settlements
were begun along the Osage waters, of which Osawatomie
was the chief, and most famous in the annals of
Kansas.

of the ability to make head against the multiplied
difficulties of time and place, could well have been chosen.

<h4>
THE BATTLE FOUGHT AND WON.
</h4>

<p>
It was the doom of slavery that it should require the
destruction of every thing that stood in its way. This
being conceded, a resort to lawlessness—more especially
on the part of a rude population like that of the
Missouri border—was sure to follow the attempt to
set up a free commonwealth in Kansas.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_300' name='Page_300' href='#Page_300'>300</a></span>
</p>

<p>
From the moment the organic Act became law, the
future of Kansas was ever and foremost a national question.
The Southern leaders had told the Missourians,
if they would not see political power wrested from the
South, they must secure Kansas to slavery at any cost.
The North had met the challenge in the words of
Senator Seward, who said, "Come on, then, gentlemen
of the slave States! Since there is no escaping your
challenge, I accept
it in behalf
of freedom.
We will engage
in competition
for the virgin
soil of Kansas,
and God give
the victory to
the side that is
stronger in
numbers, as it
is in the right."

</div>

<p>
The people of Western Missouri, of whom glimpses
have been given in former chapters, were typical American
borderers, rude of manner and speech, scarcely
touched by the refining influences of the older East,
open-handed and hospitable to a fault, but capable of
committing brutal excesses when their passions were
aroused, as they now were by the overwrought appeals
of their most trusted leaders to make an end of abolitionism,
if they would not see it become a menace to
their domestic peace,—an incitement to insurrection
or ceaseless turbulence along their border. Their character
may be guessed from the name which in a spirit of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_301' name='Page_301' href='#Page_301'>301</a></span>
bravado they took from their opponents' mouths,—that
of border ruffians. They were expert with the rifle,
daring riders, accustomed to out-of-door life from infancy,
and hardened by experiences drawn from the
vicissitudes of frontier life, into the bone of a self-asserting
Americanism of the Davy Crockett school. Then,
inasmuch as public opinion justified the settlement of
private quarrels with the pistol or bowie-knife, the
taking of life was held cheaply as compared with communities
where the enforcement of law is the safeguard
of the citizen. Add to this the frontiersman's habitual
scorn for those reared in cities, or who shunned a resort
to violence in support of their principles, and we have
the measure of those adversaries whom the free-State
men of the North were to face on their own ground,
and with their own weapons in their hands.

<p class="caption">A SQUATTER MOVING HIS CLAIM.</p>
</div>

<p>
The events flowing from this state of things may be
briefly summed up.
</p>

<p>
While the free-State movement was steadily gaining
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_302' name='Page_302' href='#Page_302'>302</a></span>
ground by the coming-in of actual settlers, the Missourians
made determined efforts to stay it, first by seizing
upon the government of the Territory, and next by
intimidating or driving out all who opposed their lawless
acts. Thus an election for members of the Territorial
Legislature (March, 1855) was controlled by Missourians
who, in the most open manner, came into the voting
precincts with arms, cast their ballots unchallenged, and
then went home again to Missouri, so returning a law-making
body by unlawful votes. This Legislature
enacted laws establishing slavery. The free-State men
refused to recognize it or its laws. They proceeded to
form a constitution<a name='FA_240' id='FA_240' href='#FN_240' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> prohibiting slavery, with which
they asked admission into the Union. They also elected
State officers, and a legislature which they meant to put
in operation if worst came to worst. Meantime they
organized themselves to repel force with force if necessary.
All those who were opposed to making Kansas
a slave State, now came together as the free-State
party.
</p>

<p>
This party, which had just elected Charles Robinson
governor, refused to pay taxes, obey writs, or in any
way abide by the acts of the so-called bogus legislature.
The pro-slavery party declared this treason. Congress
rejected the Topeka Constitution, the House voting for
its admission, the Senate against it.
</p>

<p>
In consequence of the rescue of a free-State man from
the hands of the sheriff, Lawrence was soon besieged by
a large force of Missourians, assembled under color of
law, but in reality invaders of the Territory. The people
of Lawrence prepared to make a sturdy defence by
building earth-forts at all the approaches to the town,
in which men armed with Sharpe's rifles were constantly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_303' name='Page_303' href='#Page_303'>303</a></span>
stationed. Seeing them determined to fight, the Missourians
left without venturing to attack them.
</p>

<p>
Finding the free-State men thus firm, the other party
next invoked the judicial power to aid them in breaking
up the combination made against the enforcement
of illegal laws. Governor Robinson and many other
free-State leaders were indicted for treason<a name='FA_241' id='FA_241' href='#FN_241' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> by a grand
jury, acting upon instruction of the chief justice, who
defined the acts of the free-State men as levying war
against the Federal Government. Robinson and others
were arrested and imprisoned.
Some of
the leaders escaped
out of the Territory.
</p>

<p class="caption">MUD FORT, LAWRENCE.</p>
</div>

<p>
Bills of indictment
had also been found
against the two newspapers
printed at Lawrence,
as well as the
hotel in which the
free-State men were in the habit of holding their meetings.
These were declared public nuisances. Under
the color of law, an armed posse proceeded to Lawrence,
threw the presses into the river, gutted the hotel, and
burned Governor Robinson's house to the ground. This
took place May 20, 1856.
</p>

<p>
The next act of the actual government was the calling-in
of United States troops to disperse the free-State
legislature, which met at Topeka, July 4. All these
proceedings had aroused the keenest interest throughout
the Union, and while in Kansas opposition to oppression
was momentarily quelled, it was acquiring greater
strength<a name='FA_242' id='FA_242' href='#FN_242' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> in all the free States.

<p class="caption">JOHN BROWN.</p>
</div>

<p>
Among the free-State men were some who believed
such acts as had been committed at Lawrence called
for reprisals in kind. Of these, James H. Lane<a name='FA_243' id='FA_243' href='#FN_243' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> obtained
a wide notoriety; but the animating spirit was
undoubtedly John Brown of Osawatomie,<a name='FA_244' id='FA_244' href='#FN_244' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> who held
that the policy of submission was all wrong, and that
the pro-slavery men too must be made to fear for their
own safety before
peace could be
had. He avowed
himself in favor of
giving blow for
blow. This idea
found much favor
with the fighting
portion of the free-State
men. On
the question of
slavery, Brown's
mind was surely
unsettled by the
all-engrossing idea
that slavery was a
thing of violence
which must die a violent death. To bring this about
was now the one purpose of his life, and in pursuit of
it he was as inexorable as fate. For its accomplishment
he possessed certain qualities that make either
the hero or martyr according as the purpose is weighed
by history. An iron will, religious fervor amounting
to fanaticism, were joined to a calm but resolute courage
which no danger could daunt or turn from its
purpose. He was a seventeenth-century Puritan of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_305' name='Page_305' href='#Page_305'>305</a></span>
Cromwellian stamp—a man of iron belonging to an
iron age.
</p>

<p>
Brown soon had the border in terror of his deeds.
The blows he struck were swift, secret and deadly. It
was now the pro-slavery men who were driven out or
assassinated, or had their homes fired at dead of night.
Men sent to
take him
were themselves
taken
and held
as prisoners.
These acts
led to retaliation,
retaliation
to
fresh outrages,
and
for a time
Kansas was
given over
to violence.

<p class="caption">BROWN'S LOG HOUSE.</p>
</div>

<p>
Believing Congress
would admit them to the Union,
the slavery party also formed
a State Constitution at Lecompton, the capital. But
an election for a new legislature had overwhelmingly
defeated them, thus giving control of the Territorial
body to the free-State men at last. So the Lecompton
men now saw no hope for themselves except in their
State Constitution. As they refused to submit the
whole instrument to the people, the free-State men refrained
from voting for or against the single proposition
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_306' name='Page_306' href='#Page_306'>306</a></span>
of "slavery" or "no slavery," seeing they must get the
detested Constitution in any event. The returns showed
the old determination still strong to fasten slavery on
the people against their will. A large majority was
obtained for the Constitution by stuffing the ballot-boxes
with fraudulent votes. Of six thousand and odd
votes (6,226), nearly half (2,720) were illegally cast.
The Lecompton Constitution was, however, sent to Congress
by President Buchanan with his approval. In
Congress it provoked a stormy debate, was sent back to
the people of Kansas for final ratification, and by them
decisively rejected at the polls, August, 1858.
</p>

<p>
Though Kansas was kept out of the Union three
years longer, her attitude in respect to slavery was now
so little doubtful that the pro-slavery men gave up the
contest in despair.
</p>

<p>
To maintain their cause with the country at large,
and make it one on which the opponents of slavery
could unite, the free-State men of Kansas lived for a
time nearly in chaos rather than forfeit the name of
law-abiding people. In this they showed admirable
self-restraint. To maintain themselves in Kansas they
were forced to adopt the tactics of their assailants at
last, and deal blow for blow. Cultured people were
roughened by this sort of life. It made them reckless.
It weakened respect for law, even with the law-abiding.
It brought material progress to a standstill, and engendered
lifelong enmities among men who were to live
together as neighbors. Social improvement was put
back years. The very existence of a conflict had the
tendency to bring bad men to the front, whose influence
proved a hinderance to the settling of order in the
State. The contest in Kansas proved Douglas wrong
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_307' name='Page_307' href='#Page_307'>307</a></span>
and John Brown right, in so far as the question of
peaceful competition for the soil was involved in it.
In a national sense it was therefore but the prelude to
the great Civil War of the century.

<h4>
GOLD IN COLORADO, AND THE RUSH THERE.
</h4>

<p>
It had long been predicted by those most familiar
with the general characteristics of the Rocky Mountains,
that eventually they would be found rich in mineral
wealth. One of the earliest and most sanguine
advocates of this idea was Colonel William Gilpin of
Missouri, whose predictions, when viewed in the light
of later knowledge, seem like the gift of prophecy.
Reports were indeed more or less current at Salt Lake
of the finding of gold among the mountain streams of
the Great Basin, as far back as 1848, but all search for
it was discouraged by the Mormon leaders as tending
to bring upon them a swarm of adventurers whose
presence would inevitably work the ruin of their isolated
republic, and so render all previous toil and hardship
of no avail. We have seen that such reports had
reached the Mormons in California, who were preparing
to go to Salt Lake in consequence of them.
</p>

<p>
Then, the existence of rich silver-mines among the
mountains of New Mexico, which the Spaniards had
been working for an unknown period of time, in the
rudest possible way, was a thing of common knowledge
from the time of La Salle, though the secrecy observed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_309' name='Page_309' href='#Page_309'>309</a></span>
in regard to them effectually shut out inquiry as to
whether the business were profitable or not. But California
was so long the goal of all seekers after gold,
that it was not until her gold-fields began to give out,
and people began to ask "What next?" that the great
backbone of the continent, over which the emigration
had rushed so long and heedlessly, suddenly stopped
them with the question, as one might say, "Why not
search me?"

<p>
The first report of the finding of gold at the eastern
base of the Rocky Mountains reached the Missouri
River in July, 1858, but
did not gain much credit
till several months later.
By October, however,
the fever was at its
height on the frontier,
and had made some
progress toward the
east. Though several
parties started out from
the border towns of
Kansas and Missouri,
the lateness of the season
prevented many from going at this time. Meanwhile,
however, reports continued to come in, each
seemingly well authenticated and more conclusive, as
to the main fact that gold existed in paying quantity
not far from the foot of Pike's Peak. The region where
report located the discoveries therefore took to itself
the name of this magnificent mountain, whose sides
were vaguely supposed to be veined with the precious
metal found in the sands of the Platte.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_310' name='Page_310' href='#Page_310'>310</a></span>
</p>

<p>
After much prospecting, the ground along Cherry
Creek, a small tributary of the South Platte, was fixed
upon as one promising the best results to the miner.
It accordingly became a base for future operations
which were to be pushed up into the heart of the mountains.
First known simply as Cherry Creek, the camp
of the earliest comers soon took to itself the name of
Denver City,<a name='FA_245' id='FA_245' href='#FN_245' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> from James W. Denver, governor of Kansas,
of which this gold
region then formed
part.

<p>
With the coming
of spring, and
opening of navigation
on the
Missouri, emigrants
began to
pour into the
various points
of departure for
the new gold
region. From
Omaha to Independence
unprecedented
bustle prevailed all along the border. Many
started off on a journey of seven hundred miles on foot.
Some put their worldly goods in hand-carts to which
they harnessed themselves. One man is said to have
trundled a wheelbarrow from Kansas City to Cherry
Creek. Most emigrants, however, went in wagons over
the now well-marked roads of the pioneers, and by night
the prairies were lighted up far and near with their
camp-fires.

<p>
In view of the rush to Pike's Peak, the firm of Russell,
Majors &amp; Waddell, which had for years transported
supplies to the military posts of Kansas, Utah,
and New Mexico, now put on a line of daily coaches
from Leavenworth to Denver, which were run up the Republican,
and
thence to the
Platte. Thus,
after the Indian
pony, the
trapper's caravan,
the explorers'
and emigrants'
cavalcade,
comes at
last the modern
stage-coach
with its
promise of
greater things to follow in its track. On the 21st of
May the first coach reached Leavenworth on its return
from the mountains, bringing only a few thousand dollars
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_312' name='Page_312' href='#Page_312'>312</a></span>
in dust; but in that month John H. Gregory, an
old Georgia miner, found rich deposits of gold in the
mountains among the
headwaters of Clear
Creek. This discovery
established the value
of Colorado as a gold-bearing
region.

<p>
When visited in 1859
the Gregory Diggings
were found in a gulch
along which log cabins,
tents and camps, hastily
covered in with
boards or pine boughs,
were scattered for miles. There were then five thousand
people in them, and more were coming in every day.
</p>

<p>
Here the experiences of California life were repeated.
Some men were taking out
two hundred dollars a day;
others who worked equally
hard did not get five dollars
a day for their labor. It resulted
that a stream of confident
and cheerful ones were
constantly going in, while
not a few who had failed to
find fortune in the diggings
were as constantly coming
out, crestfallen and in rags.

<p>
In 1859 Denver had about
one thousand people, who lived in three hundred rough-hewn
log houses. Very few of them had glass windows,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_313' name='Page_313' href='#Page_313'>313</a></span>
or doors, or other floors than the bare ground. Hearths
and fireplaces would be built of adobe, as in New
Mexico, and chimneys of sticks laid crosswise one on
the other, with the interstices filled with mud, as the
New-Englanders of
1630 were accustomed
to make
theirs. As no
rain falls except
during
the summer
months, life
in the open
air caused
little discomfort
to people
who, being
obliged to make the most of every thing, easily
learned to do without what are called luxuries.

Picturesquely set up among these homely dwellings
of the whites, one
saw many skin lodges.
These belonged to a
band of Arapaho Indians,
who had thus
pitched their camp in
the heart of the growing
city. Golden City
in the north and Colorado
City in the south
were soon founded.
The first was an intermediate point on the route to
the Gregory Diggings; the second was started at the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_314' name='Page_314' href='#Page_314'>314</a></span>
foot of Pike's Peak, near to the famous <i>Fontaine

<p>
In a few months more Denver had grown to a city
of brick and frame buildings, with two theatres, a mint
coining the gold of its own mines, and rival daily
newspapers. It had quite reached the second stage
of development of
frontier cities.

<p>
The surface, or
placer, diggings of
Colorado were soon
exhausted, but in
their place belts of
gold mixed with
quartz were struck
all the way from Pike's Peak in the south to Long's
Peak in the north. Above this gold belt, rich silver
ores were sometimes found on the very summits of the
mountains. These discoveries soon changed mining
from a pursuit in which every one could engage, and
which had drawn such numbers into Colorado in the
beginning, to the larger operations of capital, with all
the appliances modern science brings to its aid.

<h4>
THE PACIFIC RAILROAD.
<br />
<span class="s08"><i>In time of war prepare for peace.</i>
</span>
</h4>

<p>
In about half a century we have seen the great body of
the nation moving more than five hundred miles westward.
It has moved forward like an army taking the
field, planting its outlying settlements before it at all
strategic points,
the possession of
which was essential
to the success
of its peaceful mission.
This army
has marched at
the rate of ten
miles a year, mostly
along the thirty-ninth
parallel, to
which the advantage
of soil and climate was its infallible guide. Its
destination was the Pacific Ocean.
</p>

<div class="figleft">

<img src="images/i-326.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt="" />
<p class="caption">QUAKER GUN AT STAGE STATION.</p>
</div>

<p>
We have also witnessed the occupation of the Pacific
coast, the rise of two great States there whose people
were already stretching their hands out toward the East
as if to hasten its coming. The genius of civilization
hovered over and directed this grand march, which
never halted but to re-form its lines and go forward
again with stately tread.
</p>

<p>
We have further seen a third body firmly plant itself
among the fastnesses of the Rocky Mountains, whose
mission was to extend its own civilization both to the
East and West, as the pebble which is dropped into a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_316' name='Page_316' href='#Page_316'>316</a></span>
pool sends out its ever-broadening circle upon the surface
of the waters. Thus the people of New Mexico,
Colorado, and Utah, were already throwing out little
colonies into the later Territories of Nevada, Arizona,
Idaho, and Montana. Thus these Territories were the
heralds of the coming East. And in this manner the
vigorous West had secured in advance the strongholds
which, in a physical sense, impeded the march toward
the Pacific.
</p>

<p>
As it went forward, the East brought all the appliances
of civilization with it, and set them working all
along the line. In 1859<a name='FA_247' id='FA_247' href='#FN_247' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> the locomotive and telegraph
reached the eastern frontier of Kansas. There was now
a gap of two thousand miles remaining to be closed up
between the Missouri and the Pacific. How to bridge
this over, and by so doing bring widely separated sections
together, was a question now assuming national
importance in men's minds.
</p>

<p>
The West demanded it should be done without more
delay; the older sections responded in the spirit of
national progress.
</p>

<p>
Private enterprise had already accomplished something
toward the desired object. In the summer of
1859 the same energetic firm that had sent the first
stage-coach across the wastes of Western Kansas to Denver,
put on a pony express<a name='FA_248' id='FA_248' href='#FN_248' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> to run between the Missouri
River and the Pacific. Stations were established
twenty-five miles apart on the open prairie, where fresh
animals and riders were kept ready saddled and
equipped for the road. Mounted on his hardy little
Indian pony, the courier rode with whip and spur to
the next station, where, whether by night or day, he
stopped only long enough to snatch a mouthful, mount
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_317' name='Page_317' href='#Page_317'>317</a></span>
a fresh pony, and secure his letter-pouch behind him.
He then dashed on again at the top of his speed.
Though one of the oldest known methods of carrying
news, the difficulties were here such as seldom have
been overcome. By dint of hard riding, despatches were
sometimes delivered in Denver in less than three days,
and in Sacramento in eight days, from the time of
setting out.
</p>

<p>
The Butterfield Overland Stage Company<a name='FA_249' id='FA_249' href='#FN_249' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> established
between St. Louis and San Francisco (1859) was
a more serious
undertaking.
It ran coaches
every day in
the year, over
the longest
stage-route in
the world, traversing
a distance
of near
three thousand
miles from end
to end.
</p>

</div>
<p>
Even such
achievements as these were regarded as make-shifts
which the coming railway should set aside. That and
that only would solve the problem how permanently to
unite and hold together such remote sections of the
Union. In the East the country has always been settled
before railways were built: in the West railways are
expected to bring settlement with them, or even to go
before it in a case like the present one. But without a
country to support it, the proposed Pacific Railway<a name='FA_250' id='FA_250' href='#FN_250' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_318' name='Page_318' href='#Page_318'>318</a></span>
was something too vast for private enterprise to grapple
with. From the time it was first talked of, the enterprise,
therefore, assumed a national character and importance.
</p>

<p>
But the slavery question had now brought on a
national crisis. Too long it had hung over the land
like a storm-cloud that is to overwhelm it with ruin.
The election of Abraham Lincoln to the Presidency
(1860) was followed by the secession of most of the
slave-holding States (1861), secession by civil war, and
civil war by the abolition of slavery in the land. All
the resources of the country being needed to carry on
the war, it would seem, at first sight, no time could be
worse chosen for pressing the claims of the Pacific Railway
than when men so doubted and feared for the
nation itself.
</p>

<p>
The people, however, thought otherwise, and they
were to rule. Indeed, at the moment the Union was
most seriously threatened with dissolution, the idea of
binding the Great West more firmly to it seemed
dictated by a wise forecast, since, if remoteness were
to be an element of weakness to the nation, then the
sooner that remoteness were done away with, the better
for its security.
</p>

<p>
Congress made liberal offers of moneys and lands, and
work began both in California (1862) and Nebraska<a name='FA_251' id='FA_251' href='#FN_251' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a>
(1863). The route from the Missouri first begun followed
the old emigrant trail up the Platte Valley, thence
crossing the mountains into the Utah Basin, where the
road from the west was expected to join it. As the
Platte Valley is nearly a dead level from the Missouri
to the mountains, the work went on rapidly over this
part of the line. Twelve thousand men were employed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_319' name='Page_319' href='#Page_319'>319</a></span>
on it. In front gangs of laborers shovelled up the loose
earth to form the embankment; after these came the
tie-layers and track-layers; who were again closely followed
by the locomotive, with the cars in which the
workmen slept and ate since leaving the settlements
behind them.
</p>

<p>
When the track neared the Black Hills, the Indians
tried to stop its farther progress. They looked upon
its coming as destined to drive away the buffalo from
their old feeding-grounds,
and
so starve them
out of their
country. In this
belief they attacked
the laborers,
tore up the
tracks, and so
harassed the
builders that the
work could only
go on under the
protection of United States soldiers. Some well-meaning
people thought it wrong thus to invade the Indians'
hunting-grounds for any purpose whatsoever, and Wendell
Phillips rejoiced that they had risen in defence of
them. Said he, "All hail and farewell to the Pacific
Railroad! Haunt that road with such dangers that
none will dare use it!"

<p>
The work, however, steadily went on. On the 10th
of May, 1869, the two ends came together at Promontory
Point, Utah, and with impressive ceremonies the
Pacific Railway was opened to the traffic of the world.

the first passenger train reached the top
of the Sierra, Nov. 30, 1867. The Union
Pacific did not push its work until the
war was nearly over. By the autumn
of 1866 it was forty miles west of Fort
Kearney. By the time the Central
Pacific was in the Truckee Valley (140
miles built), the Union Pacific was at the
Black Hills (500 miles built). Brigham
Young built a portion of the road in Utah.

<h4>
KANSAS, NEVADA, NEBRASKA AND COLORADO
ADMITTED.
</h4>

<p>
Kansas came into the Union (1861) as the seceding
States went out. Though peaceful progress was arrested
by the war, which kept most of her able-bodied men in
the field, she, the youngest State, did her part bravely
and well in that memorable conflict of arms, by the
side of the older ones. She kept the name of the
nation which had dwelt along her great river before
the coming of the white men. With the cessation of
civil strife began an era of prosperity, hardly paralleled
in the history of the nation, and owing, chiefly, to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_321' name='Page_321' href='#Page_321'>321</a></span>
fertility of her soil, which has raised her to the front
rank of agricultural States.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Nevada</span><a name='FA_252' id='FA_252' href='#FN_252' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> may be said to have sprung from the side
of California, though originally forming part of Utah.
For a time it was known only as Washoe, from the
Indians living about the east foot of the great Sierra.
</p>

<p>
A little surface gold was found here as early as
1850 by emigrants who carried the news to California.
Their report brought a number of eager gold-seekers
into the gulches around what has since grown up to be
Virginia City, and it was while searching for gold that
rich silver ores were discovered early in 1859, on Mount
Davidson. Here on the eastern slope of this mountain,
near the newly discovered silver lode, the town of
Virginia began with a few log huts. In sixteen years
it had a population of twenty-five thousand. In 1864
Nevada was admitted to the Union.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Nebraska</span><a name='FA_253' id='FA_253' href='#FN_253' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> in soil and climate is quite like Kansas,
though somewhat less fertile. Though opened to settlement
at the same time Kansas was, emigration was
mostly directed to the latter State by the slavery excitement.
In 1861 the area of Nebraska was much
reduced by the forming of Dakota, though it is still
larger than all New England. Omaha,<a name='FA_254' id='FA_254' href='#FN_254' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> Plattsmouth,
and Nebraska City grew up as outfitting points for the
commerce of the plains. All were villages in 1857.
As the railway system of Iowa unerringly directed
itself toward the Platte, Omaha, the capital, grew in
importance; but when the terminus of the Pacific
Railway was fixed there, its future was assured. From
this time onward the progress of Nebraska was marked.
In 1867 it came into the sisterhood of States.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Colorado</span> was named for the great river which rises
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_322' name='Page_322' href='#Page_322'>322</a></span>
among its mountains. It was formed (1861) of portions
taken from New Mexico, Utah and Kansas. Besides
its mineral wealth, the raising of sheep and cattle
has grown to be a great industry. In 1876 Colorado
was admitted to the Union.

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_252'>[1]</a></span> <span class="smcap">Nevada</span>, Spanish for "snowy," is
aptly called "The Desert State." Except
lead and silver it produces little or
nothing. Carson, the capital, is named
for Fremont's old guide. Though silver-mines
were also opened in the Reese
River District (Austin) the chief mineral
deposits were found about Virginia City.
A great rush set in there from California,
where the excitement about Washoe
quite rivalled, for a time, that of 1849.
Here are the great Comstock, Gould and
Curry and other rich silver lodes. This
explains why population is chiefly concentrated
in one spot in the west of the
State. California is its natural outlet.
In sixteen years the Comstock mines
yielded over two hundred million dollars
in silver bullion.

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_253'>[2]</a></span> <span class="smcap">Nebraska.</span> When I visited Nebraska
(April, 1858), a few settlements
were begun on the Nemaha, Saline, Big

Independence, Kansas City, Leavenworth
and St. Joseph. In 1872 the

to Nebraska, urging the Red

In 1866 its population had risen to eight
thousand.
</p>

</div>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<h4>
THE RECENT STATES.
</h4>

<p>
It is at least worthy of notice, in following out the
law governing the movement of our people from east
to west, that the great block of wilderness country
which Lewis and Clarke first explored should be the
last settled. The course their explorations took passes
through Dakota, Montana, Idaho and Washington to the
Pacific Ocean.
</p>

<p>
The reason for this long pause between the first and
last acts in the story of the Great West is found in
the fact that later exploration soon determined in favor
of the Platte Valley, as the one affording by far the
shortest way through the centre of the continent.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_323' name='Page_323' href='#Page_323'>323</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Therefore the new States, just named, are mostly an
outgrowth of the more central region in which the
great body of emigration has first settled. It may be
further remarked, that in those Territories where gold
and silver occur, settlement was nearly simultaneous.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Idaho</span>,<a name='FA_255' id='FA_255' href='#FN_255' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> like Nevada, grew up from the discovery of
gold and silver in her borders. The finding of these
precious metals goes no farther back than the summer
of 1862. These were placer deposits. A year
later quartz lodes, rivalling in richness those of Colorado,
were brought to light. Soon the old Hudson's
Bay post of Fort Boisé<a name='FA_256' id='FA_256' href='#FN_256' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> was turned into a thrifty town.
The mineral find rapidly extended along the Salmon,
Boisé, and Clearwater Rivers. In the south, Idaho
City sprung up on the Boisé; in the north, Lewiston on
the Clearwater was settled. In 1860 Idaho scarcely had
any white people: in 1863 they were sufficiently numerous
to entitle them to have a Territorial government.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Washington</span><a name='FA_257' id='FA_257' href='#FN_257' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> is another rib taken from the side of
the older Oregon, whose boundaries so fortunately gave
us the magnificent harbors embraced by Puget Sound.
Here therefore is the natural terminus of the Northern
Pacific Railway,<a name='FA_258' id='FA_258' href='#FN_258' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a> which comes from Duluth and St.
Paul, crosses the tier of States now under consideration,
and reaches Tacoma by way of the Lower Columbia.
Washington was made a State in 1889.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Montana.</span><a name='FA_259' id='FA_259' href='#FN_259' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> About all known of this Territory in
1860 was that it contained two important military posts:
Fort Benton at the head of navigation on the Missouri,
and Fort Union near the mouth of the Yellowstone.
But in 1861 gold was found in a gulch lying at the head
of the Jefferson Fork of the Missouri. Population
rushed in. Here Bannack City was founded. As with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_324' name='Page_324' href='#Page_324'>324</a></span>
Colorado and Nevada, so here the surface diggings were
quickly worked out. In 1862 Virginia City was founded
as the successor of Bannack; and in 1863 Helena as the
successor of Virginia, and supply-point for the mines of
the Blackfeet country. Montana was organized as a
Territory in 1864. A year later there were but four
post-offices, at which tri-weekly mails were received,
while but one newspaper was printed in the Territory.
Yet even at this early day, when mining engrossed the
attention of nine-tenths of the population, it was seen
that the agricultural resources of Montana were very
great, and since the building of the Northern Pacific
Railway along the Yellowstone, that valley has become
to Montana what the Willamette is to Oregon. Montana
was admitted to the Union in 1889.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dakota</span> has signally demonstrated its capacity for
supporting large populations, either by raising grain
crops or live stock, for which the wild grasses of the
plains furnish abundant pasturage. Divided by the
Missouri in the centre, and bounded on the east by
the Red River of the North, Dakota has come to be a
great wheat-producing region in its eastern half, and a
cattle-growing one in its western. Made a Territory in
1861, Dakota came into the Union as two States (North
Dakota and South Dakota) in 1889.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Wyoming</span> contains in its north-western corner the
wonderful Yellowstone Park, which Congress with wise
forecast has set apart for the benefit and instruction of
mankind. At no distant day this remarkable and picturesque
region bids fair to become the chosen playground
of the nation.
</p>

<p>
Thus the Great American Desert, which only to have
crossed was once thought a feat worthy of being handed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_325' name='Page_325' href='#Page_325'>325</a></span>
down to posterity, whose length and breadth were vividly
portrayed as never meant to be inhabited by man, is now
everywhere supporting large and prosperous populations.
</p>

<p>
It is but just to add that the Mormons first disproved
this popular fallacy by making their homes in the heart
of the desert, which imperfect knowledge first led them
to choose, and necessity afterward forced to make trial
of. These people have therefore done a work as remarkable
in its way as that performed by the early
New-England colonists.
</p>

<p>
It should further be added, that the occupation of
these Territories, notably Montana and Dakota, was productive
of serious conflicts with the Indians, who fought
to the death for the preservation of their last hunting-grounds.
The Sioux war of 1876 was caused by the
rush of gold-seekers into the Black Hills, which the
Sioux had reserved to themselves. They attacked
the whites, to whose aid soldiers were sent. One band
led by General Custer perished to a man on the Little
Big-Horn, in battle with confederate Indians, led by
Sitting Bull, a Sioux chief.

<div class="chapter">
<h4>
THE WORK OF EIGHTY YEARS.
</h4>

<p>
Our story closes with the national domain completed
within limits grander than even the sagacious Jefferson
had hoped for. Though "peace hath her victories,"
peaceful development, such as has followed the settlement
of grave political questions, affords fewer materials
for history than the stirring records of war, or the
annals of political strife.
</p>

<p>
The West shared with the East in the drain made
upon its resources by the Secession War. Its recovery
from the effects of that war has, however, been so
marked that to-day all traces of it are nearly effaced
from its outward and inward life. National unity is no
longer a thing of territorial expansion, as with the
statesmen of Jefferson's and Benton's time, but now
means a perfect union of the whole people in the cause
of progress, and for the welfare of mankind. In that
peaceful conflict the once hostile sections are now
engaged with a praiseworthy emulation.
</p>

<p>
The child who was born when Lewis and Clarke set
out for the Pacific, may now be the living witness to
what we have called the marvel of the nineteenth
century. It is true, much of the rapid progress of the
Great West is due to the development of its extraordinary
mineral wealth, by which masses of population
have been suddenly moved upon particular points, so
forcing settlement beyond its legitimate growth.
</p>

<p>
There have been, however, other potent agencies at
work to the same end. Foremost among these, always
keeping in mind the constantly improving facilities for
moving emigrants into the West, come the great improvements
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_327' name='Page_327' href='#Page_327'>327</a></span>
made in mechanical arts. And first of all
we should class the reaping-machine, invented by Cyrus
H. McCormick, which is thought to have advanced the
line of civilization westward many miles each year.
Without this invention, what was an uninhabited and
unproductive region forty years ago would hardly have
been converted into the granary of the continent, with
its millions of people, its marvellous productiveness,
and its growing weight in the nation. In the East
small farms are the rule;
in the West, the exception.
The difference, at
least, seems to be largely
owing to the grass-mower,
and grain-reaping
machines that were
unknown to agriculturists
of a former generation,
though allowance
must be made for the
better conditions of soil, which more generally adapt it
for cultivation. Great bodies of fertile lands, such as
exist in the States of Kansas and Nebraska, are unknown
in the East.
</p>

<div class="figright">
<a name="i-338" id="i-338"></a>
<img src="images/i-338.jpg" width="200" height="174" alt="" />
<p class="caption">REAPING-MACHINE.</p>
</div>

<p>
Then the building of the Pacific railways has contributed
greatly to the rise of the West. Munificently
endowed by Government with moneys and lands, the
sale of the latter to settlers became an instant and
potent means to the building-up of the unoccupied
country. In its pre-emption and homestead laws the
Government has also offered unusual privileges to all
who wished to settle on the vacant public domain; thus
putting within the reach of men of small means, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_328' name='Page_328' href='#Page_328'>328</a></span>
most valuable and productive farming lands in the
world. In this respect no government has done so
much for its middle-class population as ours. And no
population has more quickly returned to the giver the
benefits it has received.
</p>

<p>
One other active means to the making of the Great
West should not be overlooked. Passing by the explorers,
whose names are familiar, we come to a class of
men whose work was no less important in its way.
Trained journalists like Horace Greeley, Samuel Bowles,
Albert D. Richardson, Henry Villard, Thomas W. Knox,
and William Phillips, did much to make the West
known to the East in all its aspects, whether political,
social, or economical, so depicting its inside and outside
life to a multitude of readers, many of whom became
actual emigrants in consequence.
</p>

<p>
These combined agencies, all working together in
harmony, have produced extraordinary results. For
instance, at the time we bought it all Louisiana, counting
from New Orleans to the Missouri, had only about
forty-five thousand people. In 1880, under not quite
eighty years of American rule, it had over eleven
millions, or more than twice as many as all the States
had when Louisiana was ceded to us. The whole population
of French and Spanish Louisiana did not equal
that of Minneapolis, St. Paul, or Kansas City at the
present time, neither of which had a single settler at
the date of cession.
</p>

<p>
Spain thought to control the continent with a few
soldiers and missionaries. Her civilization, barbaric in
its origin, is mediæval rather than modern. In America
it could rise no higher than its source. Mexico and
Cuba, two of its earliest conquests, show what it has
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_329' name='Page_329' href='#Page_329'>329</a></span>
been able to do in the New World in three hundred and
fifty years of rule.
</p>

<p>
France frittered away her opportunities in schemes
too vast for the time or the means appointed for their
accomplishment. It is the story of force without forecast.
Her explorers overran the country, but left few
substantial footmarks behind them. One reads French
names everywhere, but sees no cities founded. The
policy of France, like that of Spain, looked more to
getting a revenue from America than colonizing it.
Hence every avenue of individual effort was made to
lead back to the royal exchequer.
</p>

<p>
Now let the man who is not yet fifty years old take
down the geography he studied when a schoolboy, and
put his finger in the middle of the State of Iowa. He
will have touched the border of that Great American
Desert whose story we have been telling him.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
